6,1.0,"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time! 
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!! 

The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers! 

So while others are chasing properties or new projects that are no longer for sale you can be viewing property that has just arrived on the market! 

Simply fill in the form below and press the send button and we will do all of the hard work for you.

12,1.0,"Dear sir,,


My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
African Information exchange Johannesburg.
.

Due to the previous war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt MUGABE. The presidents supporters invaded my
fathers farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.

Early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. He registered the box as family
treasure.

While he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.

Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
depressing because my fathers lawyer is presently
hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
permit as a refugee.

I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
this country to your country for investment. If you
think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . Your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because I
wouldnt want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

STEVEN DUBA (DR).

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************

""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.

Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)

This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy.

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

"
27,1.0,"It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

28,1.0,"ATTN:

I am Bulawa Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, 
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I

lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

Dear Sir,

IMPORTANT.

After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable 
person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( 
$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World
Countries.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This 
bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The
contract has since been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part 
of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
our own use. But under our protocol division, we 
as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
is why we are soliciting your assistance in this 
manner and regard .

As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
from adverts in the business directory . I am the 
Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and
TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. 
Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this
Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this 
opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.

We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and I and one of my colleagues 
involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the Certified 
International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.

Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel 
No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and
City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert 
Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax
you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS 
TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get
through.
NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
inform us so that we can look for another reliable 
person who can assist in this respect. 

It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be 
discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual
trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this 
transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and
security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
and feel free to go into this transaction with 
us.
But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
Thank you, and God bless.

Best Regards,

DR. SAMUEL  EBOKA.

51,1.0,"ATTN:

I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

Please do not use the reply button, reply only to 

Edmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.

God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

54,1.0,"Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a

59,1.0,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).

This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.
Thank you and God bless you.

VICTOR SANKOH

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  

Yours Faithfully,
Capt JOHN OKELE

63,1.0,"SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com

To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and
once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.

For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/

70,1.0,"My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.

I need those houses...

Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 

I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 

If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com 

Best Wishes,

73,1.0,"Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

75,1.0,"How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.

76,1.0,"I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran
ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: 

Thanks and regards. 

MR.IKE EJOH

Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time!
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!!

The property market is moving very fast in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present you with a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

 Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers!

82,1.0,"This is the bottom line.  If you can GIVE AWAY CD's for FREE to people (like 80-100 in one month) and then let ME talk to them FOR you - if you can GIVE AWAY free product samples -  then YOU can earn $5,000 in the next 30 - 45 days.

Think I'm kidding?  We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.

if you are ....
VERY BUSY or,
Aren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,
DON'T WANT to talk to people....

Then let US work FULL TIME for you.  We've helped others....
   Julie P. earned $750 in one week with us
   Jeff A. earned $6500 in 5 weeks with us

And we NOW have an EXACT business plan for you and can tell you EXACTLY what to expect with where you're starting.  No guesswork - we've done it.

And if you DO want to seriously evaluate this, we would be HAPPY to even fly you to Los Angeles at OUR expense to get a closer look!  NO KIDDING!

90,1.0,"SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

"
92,1.0,"Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed, 
MRS. ANNE  KOJO

Life Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. 
Individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.

Why do people sell their policies? 
The reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:

Pay off debts 
Fund long term care insurance cost 
Eliminate costly premiums 
Take advantage of other financial opportunities 
Make charitable contributions 
Help family members 
 
  
Life Partners Living Solutions 
  
Traditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, it can provide cash benefits for LIFE! 
  
Life Partners Objectives 
Provide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners 
Provide bids for qualified policies 
Provide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners 
Eliminate costly premium payments

108,1.0,"INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. 

Research Alert - Undervalued
August 26, 2002
XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8

Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 

Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.

Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 

Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!

How does the company do this? 

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 

Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.

While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.

 *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.

*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 

*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.

*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.

*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 

*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

115,1.0,"Greetings! 

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 
The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 
The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Mark R Sherman 

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!

"
119,1.0,"Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK
Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit
bulk emailer.  Secret techniques and tips never
before revealed.

122,1.0,"
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

134,1.0,"Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 informtion

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:
http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Hugh Zou

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

LAGOS - NIGERIA.

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents
does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security
advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 

With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under
the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last
military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to
the confines of his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a
security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
portfolio during his tenure
as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that
he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could
take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for
himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for
the execution of this endeavour are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred
Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we
can go 
through the rudiments of this endeavour.

I remain most obliged.

I am the Chairman Contract Review Committee of National

Although this 
proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is 

coming from someone you do not know 
or ever seen
before, but after due deliberations with my colleagues, I 

decided to contact you based on 
Intuition.

unclaimed contract entitlement which can easily be 

withdrawn or drafted or pay to any 
recommended 
beneficiary by my committee.

On this note, you will be presented as a contractor to 

NEPA who has executed a contract 
to a tune of the
above sum and has not been paid. 
Proposed Sharing Partern (%): 

1. 70% for me and my colleagues. 

2. 20% for you as a partner/fronting for us.

3. 10% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties 

during the cause of this 
transacton.

Our law prohibits a civil servant from operating a

you. If this
proposal satisfies you, do respon as soon as possible 

with the following information: 

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the 

fund. 

2. Your Confidential Phone and Fax Numbers.

Because mortgage rates are rising.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

151,1.0,"
                         Foreword

After thirty?three years of being a black man living in ""Ghetto America,"" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the ""Black Generation X"". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers"", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X"", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: 
 
 ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.""
""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong."" 

This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance, ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say, "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,"" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all ""we"" have time for. 
I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.
There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me,"" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex
 posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.
Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.
 Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. 
What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. 
The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. 
I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. 
The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)
Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.
In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. 
Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers"", a popular rap duo, have a song called ""I'm Still Fly"", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts:

""I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci
Suit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's
spent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly.""

Worse yet, in the song ""Grinding"", the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and

""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up
and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup""

In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. 
The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al
 luded too. 
I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. 
Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans"", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as ""Black"", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as ""Niggas,"" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as ""Ghetto"", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the
  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. 
My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.
In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno
 wledging that this absence is by design. 
There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug,"" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. 
These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that ""backward thinking"" is the main 
 cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.

161,1.0,"FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards 


COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

162,1.0,"================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

164,1.0,"A great sponsor will not make you money.
A great product line will not make you money either.
A great compensation plan will not make you money either.
A great company will not make you money either.

Some say it's a combination of the above.
Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most.

Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc.
Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone.
They wear you out long before you make any money.

What makes you money is a downline associated with a
stable company that has consumable products.

173,1.0,"
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

184,1.0,"It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

"
185,1.0,"Dear Sir,

I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of Nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account. 

There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in
favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these 
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand 
United
State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. 


Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to 
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil
service law) from operating and/or opening foreign 
accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in 
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of 
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms. 
Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To 

accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. 
Once more I want you to understand that having put
in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. 

Please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction, if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable 
transaction. 
I want to assure you that this business proposal is
100% risk free as we have done our homework
properly. 

I quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are
still in government service, which we intend to
retire from in full honor.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year. 

Thank you and God bless.

Dr James Alabi

192,1.0,"Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  

Yours Faithfully,
Capt JOHN OKELE

204,1.0,"SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)

Dear Sir, 

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
of both of us. 

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
personal belongings and as such the security company does 
not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
Terrorist fund.
 
If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
consignment.

Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
communication
 
Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
(seven) working days.

I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 

Best regards, 
Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

209,1.0,"Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the

easy money with little cost to you. I followed the

215,1.0,"How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN
HIS CLOSET!

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -
New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old
sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,
fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.

""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old
woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year"".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where
he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away
and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did
they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than
actually finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of 
""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his
computer in his bedroom.

""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever
15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one
$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top
and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to
the top of the list.

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and
really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.

""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box
had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I
was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back
home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"".  Over
the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.""  The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the
closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike
to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds.

""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks
with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the
lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a
really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me
and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next
bank down the street (laughs).""  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any
reason to be afraid.The reporting news 

team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in
the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,
""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter
legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee.

[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how
the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What 
appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you
say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the
 Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire
show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the
program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some
megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".


DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.


Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.

In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money
for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was 
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"".

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I
have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change
anything."" More testimonials later but first,

PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE

++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT
 CORNER in case of any mail problems.

 When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.


IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of
your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!


1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.


PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.


With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals
100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000
orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES
$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......
Grand Total=$555,550.00


NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment
what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on 
the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!


METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response.


We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all
orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.

=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always
send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on
me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.
I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"".

Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big"".

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete
this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money
came within 22 weeks"".

224,1.0," 

                  Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer
accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund.  To commence this
transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling
me
or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your

Previous News Releases and Announcements Their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies are in black type. June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: 
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" 
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) 
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** 
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and 
the same could be said for DOM. 
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** 
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the 
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made 
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. 
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. 
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" 
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** 
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the 
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** 
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios 
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background: 
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": 
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: Â» Â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). 
Â» Â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. 
Â» Â» was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution 
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. Â» Â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek Â» Â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries."" 
Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Â» Â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: 
Â» Â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo 
Convention (1933). 
Â» Â» was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, 
which included the United States, China and the USSR. Â» Â» was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. Â» Â» has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. Â» Â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. Â» Â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of 
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: 
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background: 
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: 
""Where Are OFCs Located? 
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. 
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less. For further information and links to documents, see: EnenKio Documents http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/ml_intro.html http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/index.html March 16, 1999: News Release 
The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was felt throughout the society.Â  Flags were flown at half mast for a week 
in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the world.Â  His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom. Â  His Majesty King Remios Hermios 
Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.Â  His 
Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE  TOP OF PAGE 
March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â  The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.Â  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.Â  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.Â  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â  While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.Â  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. 
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â  The refusal of 
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â  Your understanding is appreciated.Â

December 19, 1998: News Release 
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio 
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to 
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release 
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps 
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. 
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. 
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. 
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release 
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. 
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. 
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. 
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: Â» Â» ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". Â» Â» ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" 
Â» Â» ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every 
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" 
Â» Â» ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior Â» Â» ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" Â» Â» That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release 
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. 
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
Request for Media Response: 
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) 
Parting Shot: 
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release 
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. 
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. 
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. 
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
Â» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed 
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.

YOUR KIND ATTN.,



RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâs estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

"
255,1.0,"HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, you
will see how you can learn new skills in communication,
do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at the

CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!

************SUMMARY***************************

skills in communications and how to market on the internet.
What a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.

Step 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,
and you have not joined in this program before, then
take out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail
out $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five
Guides on communications.  For each Guide that you will
be ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white

into an envelope, address the envelope with the name and
address of the person whose name is shown under each
Guide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air

envelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************

Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.

Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.

Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.

Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.

Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.

Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.

Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.

This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.

Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************

=======REST OF MESSAGE======================

With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!

READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.

= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =

If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.

===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================

Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.

Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.

Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.

Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.

If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)

If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795

If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.

There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.

METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.

The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.

===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.

PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.

=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
===========================================
A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.

Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
emails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember, the more you send out the more potential
buyers you will reach.

IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND
EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!

260,1.0,"Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

More testimonials later but first, =======

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

266,1.0,"THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
simply delete it. 
READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
Believe it, work it. 
This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
(money) 
started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
try!! 
You will be glad you did. 
Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
delete this!!! 
------------------------------------------------------ 
First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
IN HIS CLOSET! 
Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
You most likely have just seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
15-year-old sons closet. 
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
earns in a year"". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the 
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
had discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
was more shocking than actually finding it in 
the closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
computer in his bedroom. 
""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
15-year-old. 
The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
going to work"", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 
""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
carry it all"". 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. 
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
five-dollar fee. 
[This is the end of the media release. If you would 
like to understand how the system works and get your 
$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
instructions]. 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
================================================== 
You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
home!! 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program 
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
=========================================================
=======Here is 
another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
come 
in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME 
TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
================= 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
in case something happens to your computer. 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
this 
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
work for you. 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 
=========================================================
======= 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
free 
classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
=========================================================
======= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
of 50,000. 
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
total of 
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
orders for 
Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million). 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
Total=$555,550.00 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
=========================================================
======= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT 
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
=========================================================
======= 
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
until they receive the report. 
===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
========================== 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
send 
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
are ordering, 
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME

====================== MORE 
TESTIMONIALS====================== 
'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
with 
both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
on me! 
Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
had 
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
joined 
Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
=========================================================
======= '' Not 
being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised 
when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
investment 
with a faster return and so big''. 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=========================================================
======= '' I had 
received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 
to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 
first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=========================================================
====== 
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

282,1.0,"Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSAL

ATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,

I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and Gods person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.

I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote divoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of Côte dIvoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
Côte dIvoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,provided

you cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.

1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account

meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.

Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.

Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country Côte-
dIvoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.

Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.

Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
of kin to my father.

But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
I remain yours sincerely,

KEVIN GEORGE

I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

Subject: Info on using Linux operation system?

In answer to the question in Exchange Issue #441, 
WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of 
what is going on in windows.  He suggests Linux.  

My question is can the current software on my machine 
use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how 
much software is available for Linux.  Seems all I find is 
for windows and some for the mac.  Thanks.

Hello Nicety,

I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, http://www.wonderpaint.com,  
when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441:

<snip>
 One major problem is that many programs don't release memory 
when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the 
approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, 
</snip>

I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much 
negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer 
for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's 
favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I 
have to make it do anything useful. 

If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE 
download called FreeMem which you can get here;
http://www.meikel.com

This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you 
also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. 
This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be 
running at peak performance all the time and much easier than 
constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these 
little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to 
search for.

HTH.  Tony.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #141:  http://www.floridarental.co.uk
Carol Hall
carol@floridarental.co.uk
~~~~

Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe
just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around
your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone
three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to
make your front page navigation a little less confusing?

The ""next page"" tab is right next to one that says ""bookmark
this page"" - no information until you mouseover the tab to
tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed
with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not
enough information on your openning page.
~~~~

I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL
ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.
1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the
animation and red text on the yellow background, missing
the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more
details to this important introduction. Instead of using the
'click here' button, just have a text link following directly
after the introduction.
2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,
and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on
what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text
on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially
when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the
important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.
3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but
you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed
menu and the pages are all untitled.

I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you
want the best site you can have and I think these changes
will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the
site you have the information organized and complete. I
even wanted to come and stay!
~~~~

The animations make this site look amateurish from the
beginning.  The flashing ""Bookmark This Site"" makes me
want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans
MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve
this site.
~~~~

I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the
first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between
them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know
where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should
have been up by the text and that is where I should go.

On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,
the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One
suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have
the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of
the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.

The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and
laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.
Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but
if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten
that far.
~~~~

This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read
and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.
Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste,
but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold
of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that
form a background for some images.

298,1.0,"REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 

Dear Sir,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. 

We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the
Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man
tender board appointed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 

The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 

However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 

The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.

We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . 

My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.

You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 

(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 

(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 

(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 

(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 

Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and I will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when I have heard from you. 

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Dr. Osaro Ame

Tel=234-1-776-2397
 
Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:

1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.
 
 Regards,
 
Moshood Seko Mobutu



"
305,1.0,"Hello
 
You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!
 
With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!
 
I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling.
 
I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.
 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.
 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! 
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.
 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely 
NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if 
people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to 
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.
 
This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it.
 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.
 
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This 
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune.
 
2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 
3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 
4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 
5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.
 
==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
==================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
 
Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! 
==================================================
 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
 
There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
 
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
==================================================
 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.
 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
 
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

P.O. Box 277806
Sacramento, CA 95827

 ______________________________________________________
 
$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
 
** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!! 
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.
 
Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.
 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
 
=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.
 
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""
 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.
 
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""
 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

307,1.0,"Hi !

My name is Wayne Harrison and I would like to share a
genuine, NO RISK opportunity with you.

What I have to share with you is not like any other internet
opportunities you have seen before. It is first and foremost
a CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY.

It also offers you the ability to have a share of a
new Internet Mall to buy at wholesale for yourself
or to send others and make commissions on their
purchases.

Besides this, it also offers a unique networking program
using a principle we call ""REFERNET"" Marketing. This is no
""get rich quick"" scheme, but rather a credible
and realistic way to save money and gradually develop
what can become a large, recurring residual income.

What's the best thing about this opportunity?
You can ""try it before you buy it"". That's right.
You can join the DHS Club for FREE with no risk
or obligation. 

Make sure and check out the DHS Club's own ISP, ClubDepot.com.
You'll get Unlimited Internet Access for only $14.95 / month! Included
are 5 email addresses and 5 MB web space.

To get your free membership and to learn more about
the DHS Club and our exciting REFERNET Marketing
Program and Postlaunch, visit my web page at


http://lwharris.0catch.com/  


Remember, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain!


Best Regards,

Wayne Harrison

Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.=A0 I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise=20
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.=A0 It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""=A0 Like you, I was skeptical at first, but=20
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks,=20
so I told her I'd give it a try.=A0 I mean, there was nothing=20
to lose except a lot of weight!=A0 Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.=A0 Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.=A0I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having=20
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me -=20
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which=20
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid=20
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!!=20

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.=A0=20
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence=20
to gain!=A0 You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.=A0 This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!=A0=20

<b>QUESTIONS: </b><p>

From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com <br>
Subject: Using pictures as links <p>

I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>

How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>

--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>
<p>
A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>

I have a detailed right-up on them at <a href=""http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php""> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>
See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

Subject: Using A Proxy To Visit Blocked Sites <p>

>From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>

CJ, <p>

Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
http://www.anonymise.com and
http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>

However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

Comments on Site #123: <a href=""http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html"">http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html</a><br>
Dennis <br>
damorganjr@yahoo.com<br>
~~~~<p>

I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.<p>

I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>

As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
~~~~<p>

Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.<br>
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.<br>
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
~~~~<p>

I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
~~~~<p>

This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>

~~~~<p>

Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""<br>
~~~~<p>

A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
~~~~<p>

What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
~~~~<p>

A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads. <p>

Dennis <br>
damorganjr@yahoo.com<br>
~~~~<p>

I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.<p>

I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>

As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
~~~~<p>

Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.<br>
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.<br>
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
~~~~<p>

I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
~~~~<p>

This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>

~~~~<p>

Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""<br>
~~~~<p>

A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
~~~~<p>

What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
~~~~<p>

A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads. <p>

339,1.0,"Greetings!

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in 
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is 
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time 
mailing, so no removal is necessary.

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, 
MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that 
has ever landed in your Inbox.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, 
their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally 
flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to 
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

HERE'S GOOD NEWS

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think!

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to 
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of 
this before.

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one 
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the 
information. Period.

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type 
""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you 
within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.

Cordially,

Siddhi

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most 
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I 
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And 
it's FREE!

It is a bit slow loading as would be the case with so much animation.I guess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pages and therewas one that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimation did not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeen put into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,why don't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~This is a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funas well. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name anda host that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm... too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlike the wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedme for a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someof the links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbased or smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhere to go.~~~~This was a neat site.  The site was original and I could tell that Mrs. T certainlyseems to enjoy working on her site.  The graphics were pretty, or funny,depending on each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewas going from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedthe left rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.  Also, I thinkusing a sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did like howthe font color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.I don't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage, it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactive opinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothe site content helps when new visitors visit.On your home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.If you do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferent pictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepicture on each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website. Onyour articles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseof the background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehind that would work better.Look for a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepages but I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.I went to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is much easierto deal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~This is an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not all of whichI visited - and it has something for every member of the family, however, mostof it is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play - goodfor smaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and I wouldrecommend this site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOUR favorite!You can help out Teddy at http://www.links4profit.com by taking alook at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBay Designs http://AkkaBay.com has designed specificallyfor him.

"
352,1.0,"I saw your email on a website I visited yesterday, and thought
you might be interested in this. 

A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.

The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
seriously.

Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!

As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?

I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)

Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!

All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.

You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!

I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!

With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.

How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your downline grow?

To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:gitrman@excite.com
and write this phrase:
""Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your Free Member Number.

I'll get you entered and let you know how you can
keep track of your growing downline.

That's all there's to it.

I'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Warm regards,

Bruce Stevens

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE. All you need to do is get your free
membership.

I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

361,1.0,"DEAR SIR,

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.

No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.

Best personal regards,

MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!

It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

Equivalence Tablets & Dragon Wing Spray Remedials are comprised of entirely natural botanical factors.

367,1.0,"Some opportunities only come around every 30
years or so. This is one of those. Why?

Because interest rates are definitely rising.

Have you locked in the lowest rate (in THREE
DECADES yet!) for your present mortgage?

Rates haven't been this low in almost 3 decades.
They may well never be this low again--ever. If
you haven't taken this opportunity to secure the
best possible rate on your home loan, you're
simply letting money slip through your fingers.

At a few special times, it is SO easy to save
""big bucks""...and this is one of those times. Why
continue to pay more than is necessary and
continue to let future savings slip away?
  
We're a national mortgage provider. We're NOT a
broker. As such, we can guarantee you the lowest
possible rate and the best possible deal but only
if you act NOW.
 
There is no charge, cost or obligation to see if
this opportunity meets your needs. You can easily
determine if a new loan makes sense for you, and
exactly why, because we provide only ""easy to
understand"" quotes (in ""layman's terms"", in other
words).
 
We offer primary and secondary home loans and we
will be happy to show you in ""black and white""
why your existing loan is the best for you or why
you should replace it. Of course, there's no cost
to you at all to share your time with us. None. 

Take 2 minutes and use the link below that works
best for you. For 2 minutes of your time, we'll
show you how you can save you and your family
""big bucks"" today. This is a once-every-30-years
opportunity. So don't delay and ""miss the boat"".
Act now.

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier

This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.


1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.

2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.

3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.

4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.

5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.

6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.

7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.

8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.

9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.

10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01)

 ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~

yes   81%
no    19%

Comments:
~~~~~~~~~

No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  

We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  

The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. 

Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

They're the ones I've selected for my life at

<br>help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear
<br>on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be
<br>moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
<br>which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
<br>have even more to appreciate.
<p>2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize
<br>how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it.
<br>EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly
<br>imagine.
<p>3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.
<p>4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and
<br>drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more
<br>calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.
<p>5. Read something educational, inspirational or
<br>entertaining--preferably all three.
<p>6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
<br>Super-conscious.
<p>7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.
<p>8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of
<br>my book, then write in my journal.
<p>9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful,
<br>magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.
<p>10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.
<p>Bonus Step: Make something work better --
<br>Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

<p>No. This is a funny thing to me.&nbsp; I hear about so many
<br>people being super scared to give out their SS#.&nbsp; Well folks,
<br>I can get your SS# for 50 cents.&nbsp; Give me a name and address
<br>and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
<p>We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
<br>the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
<br>they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.&nbsp; They could do
<br>who knows what with the CC number.&nbsp; I once had a person
<br>tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
<br>of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
<br>person (me) would have her account info and could write
<br>a check out for thousands of dollars.&nbsp; I told her to just send
<br>it to me then and she said that was OK.&nbsp; Then I asked her
<br>to tell me what the difference was between the original check
<br>and a fax copy.&nbsp; I told her to ask her lawyer that too.&nbsp;
Never
<br>heard back from her.
<p>The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
<br>available in many places.&nbsp; Have a good day.

<p>How the Snore Eliminator will help you!</p>
<b>
<p>What Causes Snoring?</p>
</b></font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
<p>Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle</p>
<p>Excessive fat on the throat</p>
<p>Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and</p>
<p>Throat swelling from allergies and food</p>
<p>Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">stopping
of breathing, </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a <b>blocked airway during sleep.</p>
</b>
<p>The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a <b>weakened current of incoming air. </b>This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.</p>
<p>Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who <b>sleep on their
backs</b>; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.</p>
</font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
<p>The hidden dangers of snoring?</p>
</font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
<p>Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated</p>
<p>Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring</p>
<p>Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical condition</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
<p>Snoring decreases sexual performance</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
</font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.</p>
<p>Most people who snore have a </font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">shortage
of oxygen</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0""> for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.</p>
</font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
<p>How the Snore Eliminator works!</p>
</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">
<p>Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all </font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">natural
enzymes</font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0""> which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also</font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">
reduces the noise</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040""> made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping</font><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0"">.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the<b> </b></font><b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#800040"">throat
a chance to relax</font></b><font FACE=""MS Sans Serif"" COLOR=""#0000a0""> thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.</p>
<b>
<p>TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:</p>
</b></font><b><font FACE=""Times New Roman"" COLOR=""#ff0000"">
<p>Lorenzo writes...</p>
<p>I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.</p>
<p>PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.</p>
<p>Alex writes...</p>
<p>My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.</p>
<p>Thank you for a product that has really helped us!</p>
<p>Glen writes...</p>
<p>In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.</p>

    Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10=
,=20
2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------=20
=20
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
=20
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
-=20
known locally as The English Season.=20

Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
=20
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
=20


  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
tool?

Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
=20
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?

We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?

We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
=20
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.

We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
l=20
like to be involved in such a decision.=20


  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?

Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
This is our rule and frame of investment.


  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?

Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
-
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
magazine of all kinds).=20

Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
=20
similar status, but differing interests.=20


  Please describe one of your sponsorships

The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
y=20
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
=20
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
=20
king of sports.


  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?

Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
getting a good return on our investment.

"
386,1.0,"Hello -

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com
and in the body of the email, write this phrase:
 
""Tim, enter my name for a free membership.""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Tim Hopkins

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: sj95@yahoo.com with
""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

========================================================
Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:

To whom it may concern,

I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se!
, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?

Sincerely,

RJ

Location: Midwest, U.S.A.

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

-- Frankie R.

Location: West Coast, USA

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

========================================================
Finally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive. (Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and sweetness is never acquired inexpensively.  Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craft.  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM). Four or five draws of your pipe.as is the magical way.lingers for a good, goodly while!!!  (An herb pipe and usage instructions are included with each Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) Package.)

Seventh Heaven Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is offered exclusively in 56 gram (2 oz.) and 22 gram (.75 oz.) jiggets/bars for $115.00 and $65.00 respectively.  Sorry, no volume discounts.  Wholesale pricing is available to qualified, select merchants only.

  Equivalence Tablets  &  Dragon Wing Remedy Spray
    (Hei Ping Shun)           (Hei Long Chibang)

PLEASE NOTE:

While it is true that all physiological traumas and injuries are unique and that no product can arbitrarily eliminate all of the pain and discomfort in all people all of the time, the combination of Equivalence Tablets (Hei Ping Shun) and Dragon Wing Remedy (Hei Long Chibang) remedial botanicals does guarantee to at the least:

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

2.  Significantly increase mobility and strength ratio.
(Please remember also the significance of proper diet, excercise, rest and prayer.)

Equivalence Tablets & Dragon Wing Spray Remedials are comprised of entirely natural botanical factors.
 
While Equivalence Tablets (Hei Ping Shun) and Dragon Wing Remedy Spray (Hei Long Chibang) are extremely effective individually, they are utilized to maximum advantage when used in conjunction with one another.

Our factoryspecializes in manufacturing ¡°YEMA¡± brand acrylic composite bathtubs, we have more than 10 years experience of bathtub manufacturing and marketing. With 
our considerable experience we set out to blend the advantages of all the other of bathtubs offered in the market place into one range. After several years 
development we produced our current range and the YEMA brand bathtub was patented in 2001. We were even awarded the ""Gold Medal"" in the ""Chinese Patent Technology 
Exhibition"" and ""The Ninth Chinese New Patent Technology and New Patent Product Exhibition"" later that year. The YEMA bathtubs structural design is that of a normal 
acrylic bathtub but conglutinated into a composite material. It is ridged and is made more than twice as thick as a normal unit, making it more smooth, gentle and 
elegant. This manufacturing technique not only provides all the advantages of a normal acrylic bathtub (easily to clean, resistance to dirt, colorful,attractive etc) 
but also provides increased heat retention, and extends the products life span.

Besides our products on website, we now produce some new models for USA market. We also produce shower panels with finest quality.

China's rapid economic growth, as ranked by the World Bank, is TEN TIMES 
FASTER than the world economy. 

The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, ""How can I 
participate in this explosion?"" We have the answer. Texas-based 
CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock 
China's amazing potential.

INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITY

Texas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) 
announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to 
China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of
high pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor
of its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:
they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.

Opening China's Door

Using hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say ""goodbye"" to 
the layers of middlemen.

CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler 

CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.

CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. 

*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** 

Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. 

There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico.

419,1.0,"*****************BANNEDCD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>NET******************

I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

Dear Sir.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.

I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.

We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 

If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.

Yours faithfully,

DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

READ THIS! YOU'LL BE HAPPY YOU DID!

 A recent survey by Nielsen/Netratings says that ""The Internet
population is rapidly approaching a 'Half a Billion' People!""    

SO WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN TO YOU?

Let's assume that every person has 'only' one E-mail address.
That's 500 million potential customers and growing! In addition,

       ""E-mail is without question the most powerful
        method of distributing information on earth""

Well, I think you get the picture. The numbers and potential are
just staggering, but it gets even better ...

START YOUR OWN E-MAIL BUSINESS TODAY & ENJOY
THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:
*********************************************************
1. ALL CUSTOMERS PAY YOU IN CASH
2. YOU WILL SELL A PRODUCT WHICH COSTS NOTHING TO PRODUCE
3. YOUR ONLY MAJOR OVERHEAD IS YOUR TIME
4. YOU HAVE 100s OF MILLIONS OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS
5. YOU GET DETAILED, EASY TO FOLLOW STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS
********************************************************
  
AND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG ...
As you read on you'll discover how a 'Seen on National TV'
program is paying out excellent returns, every 4 to 5 months
from your home, for a minimal initial startup investment of
only $25 US Dollars. ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE
AND THE INTERNET!

This is the letter you have been hearing a lot about recently.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national
weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really
can make people money.

This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable 
opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time 
I passed on it.  I am so glad I finally joined just to see what 
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money 
required.  To my astonishment, I received a 6 figure income 
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

=====================================================================
Here is another testimonial: '' this program has been around for 
a long time but I never believed in it.  But one day when I received 
this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it.  I followed 
the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money 
started to come in.  First month I only made a small amount of money,  
but the next 2 months after that I made a total of a good 6 figures.  
So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made 
a lot more and I am playing it again.  The key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''  

=====================================================================
More testimonials later but first:

*****PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE & FOLLOW THESE
SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS TRUE! *****

INSTRUCTIONS:
============
**** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.

**** For each report, send $5 U.S. CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to
the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

  MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
  TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

  **** When you place your order, make sure
       you order each of the 5 reports ****

You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them.

YOUR UP-FRONT COST is ONLY $5 X 5 = $25.00.

*********Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to
send to the 1,000's of people who may order from you.
Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk
in case something happens to your computer.

**********IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people
who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the
list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps
1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you change it.

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter,
it will NOT work! People have tried to put their friends/relatives
names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it
does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
and then nothing happened.

So do not try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Remember,
honesty reaps the reward!!!

1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in
REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is
no doubt counting their money.

2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2.
6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
=========================================================

Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any
data.

To assist you with marketing your business on the Internet,
the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information that includes: How to send bulk e-mails
legally, Where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much, much more.

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

  METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
  =======================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how
it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out
only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing
receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much
better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also, many people
may send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only
5,000 each).

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each
for a total of 50,000.  Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders.  That's = 100 people responded and
ordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
5 million e-mails sent out.  The 0.2% response to that is
10,000 orders for Report #4.  Those 10,000 people send out
5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million)
Emails.  The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report #5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (a half
million).

  Your total income in this example is:
  1..... $50 +
  2..... $500 +
  3..... $5,000 +
  4..... $50,000 +
  5..... $500,000 ......... Grand Total = $555,550.00

  NUMBERS DO NOT LIE.  GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT
  THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
  CALCULATE IT, YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY!
-----------------------------------------------------------
  REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
  ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 PEOPLE YOU MAILED.

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,
or 1/2, or even one 1/5 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
each or more?  There are over 500 million people on the
Internet worldwide and counting.  Believe me, many people
may do just that, and more!

  METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
  ===================================================
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there
are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.  Placing a lot of
free ads on the Internet can easily get a larger response.
We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD
# 2 as you go along.

For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
Report they ordered.  That's it!  Always provide same day
service on all orders. This will guarantee that the emails
they send out, with your name and address on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the
report.

  ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.

Note:  Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report.
Checks or money orders are NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash
is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in
the envelope. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER
and the NAME of the Report you are ordering, your email ADDRESS,
your NAME and postal address. Make sure you affix proper
'International' Postage if ordering a report from outside your
country.

  $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
*************************************************
If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within
2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for Report #2.  If you
did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved
down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report
people are ordering from you.

  IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF
E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN!!!
  ____________________________________________________

  FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it
in any way.  It works exceedingly well as it is now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you
have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others
to #2...........# 5 as instructed above.  One of the people
you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.  Remember though, the more
you send out the more potential customers you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information,
materials and opportunity .... IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

==================== MORE TESTIMONIALS======================

'' My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  
I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled 
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''.  I made fun of the 
whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and 
percentages involved.  I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.  Jody 
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later 
she jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of her, 
and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work.  Well, the laugh was on me!  Within 
3 weeks she had received 50 responses within the next 45 days 
she had so many orders and ... all cash! I was shocked.  I
have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
===============================================================

'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make 
up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that 
I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that 
there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''.  '' I was surprised when I found my 
medium size post office box crammed with orders.  I made a large 
6 figure income in the first 12 weeks.  The nice thing about this 
deal is that it does not matter where people live.  There simply 
isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.
Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta,
Canada
================================================================

'' I had received this program before.  I deleted it, but later 
I wondered if I should have given it a try.  Of course, I had no 
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until 
I was e-mailed again by someone else ........ 11 months passed 
then it luckily came again ...... I did not delete this one! I 
made a six figure income on my first try and all the money came
within 22 weeks''. 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
================================================================

'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money 
with little cost to you.  I followed the simple instructions 
carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in.  My 
first month I made a substantial income and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was a healthy 6 figure income.
Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet''.

442,1.0,"Your Attention, Please

PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO:

(1)  abacha10@africamail.net
(2)  abacha10@mail2africa.com  
(3)  alhajiabubakar10@email.com
 

I  have very confidential and urgent business to
transact with you. But first permit me to say that I
do not know you; you are receiving this mail via blind
carbon copy of email addresses which I obtained from a
simple internet search. You are therefore NOT obliged
to reply. However, if you do, and the conditions are
right, you will be amply compensated. It is also
pertinent to add that I am using an assumed name, and
free web based email addresses for my personal
protection .
 
In order to give you a background of this ""business
transaction"", please check the website  

http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3PQPP45QC

Before proceeding further, please permit me to give
you more background on the Abacha family ""MILLIONS"" as
it is now known; please check the following websites
 
http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/aug98/17_29_059.html

http://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&ContentID=974

I have taken some pains to give you readings on the
Abacha Family fortunes; They are of  course a matter
of public record, and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES INDEED THAT
GENERAL SANI ABACHA TRANSFERRED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OUT OF NIGERIA ! However, it is conceivable and even
logical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN
""DISCOVERED"" OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IN
SYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT
OF NIGERIA. AND THIS IS A FACT!

The truth of the matter is that much more of the
Abacha fortunes are still hidden , their location a
closely guarded secret; Her Excellency, Hajia
Abacha,widow of Gen. Sani Abacha, ex-head of
State of Nigeria, who died June 8, 1998
and her immediate family are under house arrest in
Nigeria. It is therefore my job to search out a
reliable person, a complete stranger to help
transfer/secure a negotiated amount from the still
hidden millions of Dollars.  The right person must
pass a background check in order to avoid my being
betrayed to the AUTHORITIES, as happened in the past.
It is now obvious why I will be using an assumed name
for the moment. All precautions will be taken to avoid
leakages. Though I am using the internet which is
largely unsafe, as soon as I get a ""reliable""
candidate, I will introduce security measures for
every body's protection. For the moment I am simply a
""Contact Person"" for the REAL Abacha family.

In sum, the person I am looking for is an individual
or corporate body that is able to provide one or more
Bank Accounts into which arrangements will be made to
transfer US$5,000,000.00 to US$10,000,000.00 every
week; The routine, periodic transfers in small
instalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in
the wrong quarters. These transfers will be secure and
properly legal, and with all proper bank
documentation. The right person may need to establish 
fresh/new RECEIVING BANK accounts free from legal or
financial encumbrances. Persons with bad credit rating
, undischarged bankrupts, companies in receivership
and minors need not reply; Because of the stature and
confidentiality of this proposed transaction, a
successful candidate will receive 25% of all
transfers. Other Conditions, including maximum secrecy
and confidentiality  apply. 

If you are interested in helping this family, and if
you can meet our strict conditions, please reply to
all email addresses listed below. In your reply please
include your phone, fax and contact address. In the
event you do not meet our conditions after a brief
back ground check, you will be communicated
accordingly. Please before replying,  take your time
to go through all the links and investigate thoroughly
all the foregoing; this is a serious proposal, despite
the medium in which you are receiving my message.

Looking forward to your reply,

Yours Sincerely,

Alhaji Abubakar

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

                   Urgent Concern Pls.

I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK,
consumer Banking Department. Although we didn't have previous correspondence till date.
However, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is thus:
I've a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also 
receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share.
However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an  out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA.
At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an  accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange.
This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks.

Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund.
Please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer 
has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund.
Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of 
need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent
messages. 
I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. 

Be guided.

Thanking you .Yours sincerely,

Dave Framo.

.If you're sick of scams, then read this, and do what it says.

I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. Read this email to the end, follow the
instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your
retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I
know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these
before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25
going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing
this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why
that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close
to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.

Read on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical.
Not only are you making money from your own business, you're
helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.
Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get
AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital.


Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):

==================================================

Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the
business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program
to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.

Their findings proved that there are ""absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting
the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few
simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only
$25 in startup costs.""

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU
WILL MAKE.

This is what one had to say:

""I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but
each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out
that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in
this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.
Two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars
rolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.
Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find
$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I
just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so
small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.
Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?""

Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.
==================================================

Another said:

""Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never
believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to
win the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I
felt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other
$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions
meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.
As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled
my $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and
that's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already
up $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.
On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always
say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant
to be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it
says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
TRUE, GUARANTEED.

BE SURE TO SAVE A COPY OF THIS EMAIL AS A TEXT DOCUMENT FOR REFERENCE!!!!


INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports from your personal CBN money list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON
THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

=== MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer
and redistribute them. YOUR TOTAL START UP INVESTMENT: $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it
on your desk in case something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT ALTER THE NAMES OR SEQUENCE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
LISTED NEXT TO EACH REPORT.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS 1-6 VERY CLOSELY
OR YOU WILL LOSE OUT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PROFIT WHICH IS DUE TO
YOU!! Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you alter it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and proved and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!!

This is a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and
getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable
in a short period of time, and have something many people can't - a
profitable business enterprise (and more money to do WHATEVER YOU COULD
POSSIBLY WANT).

As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM!
These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do
these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,
you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.
To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to
send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified
ads and much more.

There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going:


METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails
each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%
(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just
say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this
example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100
people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail
sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million
dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
each or more?

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT
http://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to
plug in your own numbers and see the results.


METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet
will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to
become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.
Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure
proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.


$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash
will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a
different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER
BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:

Cash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole
proprietors.  However, this program will only work if you are willing
to put in the time and effort to make it work.  This is not a program
for everybody.  If you are just a passer by, and don't have a personal
vision of success, delete this now.  Life all comes down to a few
opportunities - this is one of them. Have the courage to be free, and
have the drive to reach your goals.  Before you start working with us,
take 10 minutes and write down your personal goals.  What do you want
in 5 years? 1 year? 6 months? Be realistic - set your goals high enough
so you will work hard to reach them. Remember: You are the owner of your
own destiny, make these goals become reality - only you know what needs
to be done.

You now possess the ideas, information, materials, and opportunity to
become financially independent and reach your highest dreams.  I hope
you come along for the ride, it's a wonderful world ahead.

469,1.0,"Dear fellow eBay user,

I listed this CD on eBay a few months ago and here's 
what happened.  I got an email from Safeharbor saying 
that all my auctions had been cancelled and that the CD 
was permanently ""banned"" from being sold on eBay.  From 
then on, I called it the ""Banned CD""!

So why did eBay ban it?  Maybe they figured you shouldn't 
have access to this type of information, or maybe they 
didn't think we could cram all of these programs onto 
one CD Rom.  I'll let you decide.

This CD will teach you things that eBay, Uncle Sam, and 
others just don't want you to know.  I am not responsible 
for how you use some of this information and it is 
provided for educational purposes only.  Here are just a 
few of the things you will learn ...

*** Find confidential info on anyone in 30 minutes or 
less on the Internet.  

    You'll be able to track down your old flame, find 
    out how much money your ex is hiding in their bank 
    account, or run a background check on proespective 
    client or employee.  Even government agencies have 
    trouble obtaining much of this information.  You 
    will have all the resources of any professional 
    investigator right at your fingertips - on your 
    home computer!

*** List of companies who will issue you a college 
    degree (including a Phd.) for a fee.  No study 
    required!

*** Learn how to get FREE cable and DSS channels, 
    including the adult stations and Pay-Per-View!
 
*** List of suppliers of ""questionable"" items, such as 
    fcc banned communications devices, scanners, night 
    vision goggles, passports, fake identification, and 
    everything else that you won't find in the back of 
    Soldier of Fortune magazine!

*** Find products to resell on the Internet with our 
    Wholesale Directory containing over 1 million 
    (that's right, one million!) wholesale sources for 
    computers, electronics, beanies, trend items, 
    jewelry, cars, collectibles, and everything else!  

*** Over 25 million email addresses, fresh and targeted!
    You can use these to contact the people and send 
    them your advertisements.

*** Find out how to get a completely new identity.  
    Disappear without a trace!

*** Find out how to ERASE bad credit and even create a 
    whole new file in the credit bureau computers.

*** Learn how to beat the IRS. Tax tips for the rest of
    us.

*** Complete guide on how to claim public land offered 
    by the Government. You can find your dream home for
    a ridiculously low price or buy properties to resell
    for a huge profit! 

*** Accept checks from your customers by fax, phone and
    email with the full working version of Checker 
    Software included!

*** Business software to help you run your small business, 
    including label maker software, money management software, 
    IRS forgiveness program, database software, and much more.

*** A huge collection of screensavers, graphics, clipart, 
    and desktop themes to spice up your computer.

*** MUCH, MUCH MORE that we don't have room to list!

Ask yourself this question: where else will you find such
a HUGE collection of information and software on one CD? 
And who else would dare sell you a CD containing so much 
""contraband"" info?  It was banned on eBay, has been 
prohibited in THIRTY THREE countries, and will soon be 
unavailable in the USA. If you wait more than a few days
to order this CD, I can't guarantee I will be able to 
sell it.  Get this CD *** NOW *** before it is banned forever!

We accept Visa/Mastercard, Paypal, or cash/check/money order.

only $19.99, Click on the link below to pay with a

From;Mr.David  Kargbou and Family,
         Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.
My name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la
 st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.
During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc
 ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 
Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.David Kargbou and family.

481,1.0,"Greetings -

I understand you are interested in making some money, and thought
you might be interested in this.

 A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.

The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very seriously.

Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my 
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 1000 
PAID members in my group!

 As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I 
have more than 1000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?

I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking 
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free 
sign-ups...like me :)

Well, it was true...I had over 1000 paid members in my group. This 
is a program that I had never worked!

 All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end 
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a group of over 1000
 people.

 You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!

I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this program,
 I would have become an active paid member months ago!

 With this program, you will get a HUGE group of PAID MEMBERS.
My sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every
month...on time.

How would you like to lock your position in FREE while you check
out this opportunity and watch your group grow?

To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to:  sejr102@yahoo.com
and write this phrase:

""Email me details about the club's business and consumer opportunities""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

Once I receive your reply, I will submit your information and you 
will receive an e-mail titled ""your name, Activate Your FREE Membership Today!"" You will then need to confirm your FREE Membership.
We will then send you a special report, along with your Free Membership ID Number and also let you know how you can keep track of your growing group, then you can make up your own mind.

That's all there is to it.

Warm regards,

Sean

 P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This company is different--it offers value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Subject: Earn money sending e-mails.  It's easy!
	     NEW IMPROVED reports

Dear Friend,

You can earn a lot of money in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
Seem impossible? Is there a catch?  NO, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom. 

Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then
people send me cash in the mail for information that I just e-mail
back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.

Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you
like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.

""AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION"" 

""Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS
TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following.
This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money. 

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home. And, besides even if you never
got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth
the money.  They can help you start and advertise ANY business on
the internet.  That is, these reports stand alone and are
beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet.

The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will
understand once you experience it.

system in place. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods. 
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. 

You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work. 
The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!"" 

With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business. 

Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others. 

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.

My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my
business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened
in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! 

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's
prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. All of the programs
I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one
year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! 

But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! 
After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it
correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. 

Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. 

I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN
LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT."" 

Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am
telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I
promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me. 
Here is the basic version of what you need to do: 

Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND
OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. 

Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2
within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. 

Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.
Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. 

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT
#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,
1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done. 

By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more
than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! 

In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,
I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security. 

If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke 

P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur. 

Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working. 

Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945. 

I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. 

The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor. 

As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.""
The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that. 

You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK""and ""JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined. 

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them! 

Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach. 

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW! 

""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody
Jacobs, Richmond, VA 

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ 

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. 

Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE
FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do it privately in your own home, store, or office. 

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do. 

1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell
them if you don't have them). 

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &
RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem). 

*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF
ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! 

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them. 

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 

2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. 

a. Look below for the listing of available reports. 

b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement
and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! 

c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. 

d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. 

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3 

f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. 

g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position. 

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy
and paste method works well,.

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction
portion of this letter. 

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet
Connection and e-mail is FREE! 

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. 

Here are two primary methods of building your downline: 

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL 

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. Using a good list, the response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order REPORT #2. 

Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about
level five!  That's $500,000 alone!

Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that and more! 

REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software. 

METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 

1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.
Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10
downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING
results below: 

1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000 
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000 
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000

THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550 

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants. 

THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! 

AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND
NAME *** 

* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of
those sheets of paper include: 
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and 
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS ******* 

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately. 

* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the requested product/report. 

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. 

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! 

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! 

******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* 

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 

Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?
Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when
they email you, send them this report in response! 

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 

Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders
for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! 

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business! 

Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program: 

1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO
PRODUCE! 

2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP! 

3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO
ADVERTISE! 

4. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE
WORLD! 

5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS
YOUR TIME! 

6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS
PURE PROFIT! 

7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. 

******* TESTIMONIALS******* 

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm
living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR 

My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that
I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer
now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more
years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL. 

The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in. 
-Charles Morris, Esq. 

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. 
-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA 

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA 

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy
spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY

WEMA BANK PLC. 
LAGOS/NIGERIA 
Email: ronardtony@mail.com
Dear Sir, 

REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP 

Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. 

Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. However, with my being in direct charge of
Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. 

Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- 

(a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang 

(b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. 

For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. 

Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship. 

Regards,
RONARD TONY.

2. We will show your listing more than a million times a year (guaranteed).

Let us introduce you (a million times!)

Save $100 re-listing fee
Please do not let your listing expire. Our editors listed you as one of the top websites in your category without charge. If your listing expires, however, you may need to pay a $100 editorial review fee to get listed again. It can take a month for our editors to authorize a listing. And they may not re-list you if there are too many listings in your category. 

Only TopSites-us gives you: 
* Massive Reach: We display our listings billions of times a year. We guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 
Can I change my listing?
You can change your listing now or later. You can rewrite the headline and description before renewing. You can change the URL tooeven to another website. 
Once we receive payment, we will send you instructions on how to change your listing whenever you like. (Theres no charge to do this.)

Can I change my category? 
Can I list my site in additional categories?
Can I list other sites too?
You can list as many sites in as many categories as you like. Each listing costs only $5 per month per category. Just go to www.topsitez.us. Click on the category links until you find the one you want (or search on your keywords). Click on the Add My Site link. Then type your listing. If your old listing was in the wrong category, you can click unsubscribe to cancel it.

How much does a listing cost?
Can I renew for free?
It costs $5 a month to list your site in TopSites. We no longer offer any free listings. We will bill you $60 for 12 months. There are no additional costs. You can change your listing as often as you like for free. You can cancel your listing anytime and we will refund your remaining money.

How do I pay? 
You can pay with a U.S. check, money order or bank draft. Or you can pay by Visa, MasterCard or American Express. Simply select the option you prefer on the renewal form. (Unfortunately, we cannot cash overseas checks at this time.)

Who listed us?
When did our listing start?
We do not know. Sorry. We only began to track listing contacts and dates this year.

How much did we pay to be listed? 
Originally you couldnt buy a listing--you had to wait for our editors to select you as one of the top sites in your category.

Do we have a contract with you?
We dont ask our customers to sign contracts for a $5 a month service.

Can you call me and tell me more?
We are happy to answer all your questions by email but we dont contact our customer by phone at this time. Sorry.

Can I still renew after your deadline?
We give our customers a month to renew so dont worry too much about the deadline.

How do I see my listing? I couldnt find it when I searched.
You can go to www.topsitez.us and click on the categories until you get to /Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Linux/Projects/Internet.
You can also see it at www.topsitez.us by entering two or more keywords from your listing into our search form. Since we have more than three million listings, you probably wont find your listing by searching on only one word. And you definitely wont find it if you search on words that are not in your listing. 

What keywords display my listing? 
How do I change them?
Every word in your listing is a keyword. Anytime someone searches on two or more words in your listing, we will display it. The only way to change your keywords is to change the headline or description of your listing.

How much traffic did you send us last year?
We dont know. Sorry. We are working on adding this feature.

493,1.0,"UNION BANK OF NIG LTD.
35 MARINA,
LAGOS ISLAND

DEAR Sir,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this  is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of theday. we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction,let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am the manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos NIgeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$20 million(twenty million US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development,we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim. To this effect,I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every documentto be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines,
So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money
will be for you, 10%for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be
donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues
and I.  If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter
and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.
Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of Application for
immediate Application of Claim.

Thanks for your anticipated assistance.

Yours faithfully,

DR.WALTER IBE
 
"
494,1.0,"Gooday,

With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. 

It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. 

My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.

When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. 

I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. 

To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. 

For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.

Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. 

I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.

Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

 <BR>
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones=
 <BR>
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughou=
t <BR>
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <BR>
<BR>
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are new=
ly made. <BR>
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously=
 <BR>
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their orig=
inal <BR>
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced =
to <BR>
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the abili=
ty <BR>
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related=
 symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased =
muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decrease=
d mental function and loss of libido. <BR>
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the =
<BR>
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing subs=
tance <BR>
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <B=
R>
proper dosage amounts. <BR>
<BR>
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, test=
osterone, <BR>
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are=
 tiny <BR>
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to r=
egulate <BR>
the activities of the vital organs. The word ""hormone"" is derived from a G=
reek word <BR>
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some=
 of the <BR>
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other =
<BR>
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatl=
y <BR>
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, includi=
ng <BR>
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also <B=
R>
helps restore hair color and hair loss. <BR>

Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its pr=

its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and=

*******************************June 5 2002************************************************


I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 
So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 
With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  
Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 
Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 
Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 

 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this99exit
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will dg43000sdasdfasdffgdfhyutdfsgttttrsdg
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

509,1.0,"Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

512,1.0,"Dear fellow eBay user,

I listed this CD on eBay a few months ago and here's 
what happened.  I got an email from Safeharbor saying 
that all my auctions had been cancelled and that the CD 
was permanently ""banned"" from being sold on eBay.  From 
then on, I called it the ""Banned CD""!

So why did eBay ban it?  Maybe they figured you shouldn't 
have access to this type of information, or maybe they 
didn't think we could cram all of these programs onto 
one CD Rom.  I'll let you decide.

This CD will teach you things that eBay, Uncle Sam, and 
others just don't want you to know.  I am not responsible 
for how you use some of this information and it is 
provided for educational purposes only.  Here are just a 
few of the things you will learn ...

*** Find confidential info on anyone in 30 minutes or 
less on the Internet.  

    You'll be able to track down your old flame, find 
    out how much money your ex is hiding in their bank 
    account, or run a background check on proespective 
    client or employee.  Even government agencies have 
    trouble obtaining much of this information.  You 
    will have all the resources of any professional 
    investigator right at your fingertips - on your 
    home computer!

*** List of companies who will issue you a college 
    degree (including a Phd.) for a fee.  No study 
    required!

*** Learn how to get FREE cable and DSS channels, 
    including the adult stations and Pay-Per-View!
 
*** List of suppliers of ""questionable"" items, such as 
    fcc banned communications devices, scanners, night 
    vision goggles, passports, fake identification, and 
    everything else that you won't find in the back of 
    Soldier of Fortune magazine!

*** Find products to resell on the Internet with our 
    Wholesale Directory containing over 1 million 
    (that's right, one million!) wholesale sources for 
    computers, electronics, beanies, trend items, 
    jewelry, cars, collectibles, and everything else!  

*** Over 25 million email addresses, fresh and targeted!
    You can use these to contact the people and send 
    them your advertisements.

*** Find out how to get a completely new identity.  
    Disappear without a trace!

*** Find out how to ERASE bad credit and even create a 
    whole new file in the credit bureau computers.

*** Learn how to beat the IRS. Tax tips for the rest of
    us.

*** Complete guide on how to claim public land offered 
    by the Government. You can find your dream home for
    a ridiculously low price or buy properties to resell
    for a huge profit! 

*** Accept checks from your customers by fax, phone and
    email with the full working version of Checker 
    Software included!

*** Business software to help you run your small business, 
    including label maker software, money management software, 
    IRS forgiveness program, database software, and much more.

*** A huge collection of screensavers, graphics, clipart, 
    and desktop themes to spice up your computer.

*** MUCH, MUCH MORE that we don't have room to list!

Ask yourself this question: where else will you find such
a HUGE collection of information and software on one CD? 
And who else would dare sell you a CD containing so much 
""contraband"" info?  It was banned on eBay, has been 
prohibited in THIRTY THREE countries, and will soon be 
unavailable in the USA. If you wait more than a few days
to order this CD, I can't guarantee I will be able to 
sell it.  Get this CD *** NOW *** before it is banned forever!

Dear Friend,
                
We are desparately looking for 100 lazy people
who wish to make lots of money without working.

We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.
We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich
quick' scheme offered on the internet.
We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful
people, career builders or even college graduates.
We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.

We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and
gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.
We want the people who stay in bed until noon.
We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go
lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.

If you meet this criteria, go to this site and join free:

http://www.roibot.com/w.cgi?R64190_funprogram

In case you haven't figured it out yet, we want
the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.
If you are the kind of person who will consider doing
something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.
This is too easy a way to make money
and there's no challenge in it.

If you can get to the website, you will be able to see the first home 
business in history that requires no work.  NONE.

By clicking on this link and going to

want to make enough money that you can quit
your regular job and sleep all day.

We are not looking for a commitment from you
and we don't even want your money.
As a matter of fact, we don't even want you
to hear from us again if the idea of making lots
of money without working does not interest you.

So if nothing else, remember this -

to make money without working for it just
""Join Free"".  Simple as that.

http://www.roibot.com/w.cgi?R64190_funprogram 


We look forward to hearing from you.

In all seriousness,

This is NOT a ""no work"" program that will make you money without lifting 
a finger. 

Advertising effectively requires WORK and plenty of it. Oh, for sure, it's 
not like picking cotton under a broiling sun, but it IS work, nonetheless. 

And we DO want peoples' money ONLY when they see the value of our 
products, services and upgrades. 

We look forward to hearing from you. 

Cordially your lazy friend,

527,1.0,"Dear friend,
May I briefly introduce myself to you. I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. 
The latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check News watch Magazine of May 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [Website:http://www.newswatchngr.com] to confirm the above story. Also the recent publication by this day Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovery of Abacha's family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website; http://www.thisdayonline.com, click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.
On this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.
And thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. 
My problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.
I shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. On your advice I shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. Please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893, I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam Mustafa Abacha. You should note also that my son - Mallam Mustapha Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. I would like my son (Mallam Mustafa Abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.
In acknowledgement of my proposal, I would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.
Thanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation. I am looking forward for a healthy business relationship with you  and my entire household. 

Hoping to hear from you.

Best regards,

Hajia Maryam Abacha.

Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
sell of
Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of C=F4te d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from C=F4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another nearby country where taxation will not
take great toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
business. The security of this business is very
important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential.

I shall expect your urgent reply.

My telephone number is 22507625348.

Thank you and God bless you

535,1.0,"What have you been up to?
I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! I know how you feel
- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got
to stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!""  Like you, I was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
So I tried it.  I mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!
Let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
Period.  Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,
I've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,
the service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since 
I started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount.  I want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
I give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely
WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.    

If you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""

Modern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. Nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, BIG SAVINGS!

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. Just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much MONEY to be saved! 
100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. You will be able to print as much as you
want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - GUARANTEED.
That is my pledge to you.

537,1.0,"Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

Dr. Kataga Bakori
Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002


Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.

Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.

The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.

 the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. 

I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.

Thanks for your co-operation,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Kataga Bakori

NB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1

DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE 
CRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 
HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN, OR RELATION TO 
THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, 
NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS MONEY.

TREASURY ACCOUNT. 
  
NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO 
THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER

556,1.0,"Did you know that???

Fact:	Every electrical system suffers from power surges?

Fact:	80% of electrical equipment damage is caused by surges - also known
as 'spikes'.  These spikes can damage sensitive electronics in computers
to heavy industrial motors.

Fact:	These spikes or surges hit your electrical circuits up to 400,000
times per hour.  Your electrical equipment is being gradually and
sometimes suddenly destroyed.

Fact:	OUR RANGE OF SURGE ARRESTORS will reduce your operating costs
dramatically by extending the life of all your electrical and electronic
equipment.

Motors run cooler, your fluorescent lighting life is doubled.  Your
equipment works more efficiently and your energy costs fall.

Fact:	THE SAVINGS you make in electrical consumption, electrical repairs,
electronic repair, telephone and data systems protection and lighting 
replacements can cover the cost of installing our surge and lightning
arrestors.

Even more importantly no sudden, dramatic system failure caused by
	lightning, surges and spikes.

Now you know!!

Don't let your power supply kill your business!

Email me for more information. I look forward to hearing from you.

My very best to you.

ATTN:MANAGER



HELLO DEAR,

I am well confidence of your capability to assist me
in
a transaction for mutual benefit for both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish on you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
sell of
Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of C=F4te d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from C=F4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another nearby country where taxation will not
take great toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
business. The security of this business is very
important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential.

I shall expect your urgent reply.

My telephone number is 22507625348.

Thank you and God bless you
BELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348

589,1.0,"Hi There,

I wanted to spread this good karma to you.

This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.

I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.

I am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.

Please help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!

<BR>
This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. &nbsp;The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. &nbsp;We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. &nbsp;The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.<BR>
<BR>
In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. &nbsp;I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. &nbsp;To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! &nbsp;Dear God it was me!!!

designed to only reflect &nbsp;from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. &nbsp;I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, &nbsp;but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.<BR>

&nbsp;My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. &nbsp;Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. &nbsp;My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.<BR>

 IT DOES NOT MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE!  This is an International 
business with people all over the world (over 160 different 
countries involved)!   Join our TEAM and you will succeed!  
We have the people, the knowledge and the ability to guide you... 
step by step... to a profitable business.

I AM NOT going to hype you up with Stuff trying to get you involved.
In fact, if you think you're going to make money overnight with this,
please do NOT click on the link. Simply remove yourself from this 
list (instructions below).

The difference between this online business and an offline business 
is that the tools you need for proven success... are given to you 
for FREE after you decide to create your own successful business!  
To verify what I'm saying, ask any local business person if they 
were given the tools they needed to make their business the success 
it is, for free when they started out.They'll laugh at the question!

You DO NOT need...
1.  A small fortune to get started.
2.  A lot of ""business knowledge"" or ""business contacts"" to get started.
3.  To commute anywhere, talk to anyone or buy any items to get started.

Everyday hundreds of people join for free and get the free information 
theyneed to succeed.  When they see that they too can make money with 
this business, they get involved.  There are already over 2 million 
people who have joined for free to check things out.  This business has 
been thriving for over five years!

A.  An internet connection.
B.  One or two hours a day to build your business.
C.  The ability to ask and receive all the help you need to succeed.
D.  The drive to succeed.
E.  The need for extra income each and every month.

Then YOU TOO can make MORE money for you and your family and you too 
can run your own profitable business!
This is probably the only business in the world where you personally 
reap all the rewards from your personal efforts and not those above 
you getting it instead of you (i.e. your boss).

607,1.0,"
OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.

This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.

Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:

a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 

All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  

WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 

So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.

The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.

Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!

If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!

Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youll know if its right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  

Join a small number of people who are reaping the BIG 
REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!

610,1.0,"Greetings! 

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time
mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level
marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most
important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The
pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their
friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is
fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't
yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of
income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell
you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard
of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the
information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type
""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to
you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your
Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Looking4Money 

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And
it's FREE!

612,1.0,"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.

Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.

Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

For Life"" and discover the gold within your current income.

Hello ~name~,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.  

Opex's usual rates are 4.5 cents per minute for domestic calls, with great international rates, too!

For more information on OPEX, or to sign up, please click below:

	Aren't Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal 
opportunity already?  Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded 
equal opportunity in workplaces presently.  

	Equal opportunity means: ""For every man, woman and 
child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability 
will take them.""  Statistics, mostly gathered by government 
studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all 
other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, 
corporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist 
an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of 
their potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.

	Let's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are 
employed in universities.  Their average performance has been 
outstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?  

	University administrators are recruited almost exclusively 
from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in 
universities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + 
professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the 
opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  
Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, 
for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black 
administrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white 
(non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is 
only 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out 
for yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - <www.ed.gov/NCES/ 
pubs/96323.html>, Table B-1f.

	The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 
""enlightened"" academic world.  The situation in the corporate 
world, state and federal governments is worse.  

	In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two 
major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and 
help make our beloved nation ""a more perfect Union.""   There has 
already been progress on account of that strategy.  Behold how the 
glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing
significantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in 
the 2000 election.

Asian Pacific Americans through a SWING bloc vote, ideally 
directing 80% of our community's votes and money to the 
presidential candidate endorsed by the 80-20, who better

642,1.0,"Dear Friends & Future Millionaire:

Invest in technology that will make you
money.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
You can make over half million dollars every 4 to 5
months from
your home? A one time investment of only
$25 U.S. Dollars
Puts you on the road to financial success.
ALL THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE
AND THE
INTERNET!

You can be A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"". Please  read  the
following. This is the
Letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to
The popularity of this letter on the Internet.
A national weekly
News program recently devoted an intire
show to the investigation of this
Program described below, to see if it really
can make people money.
The show also investigated whether or not
the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for that
there are ""absolutely  NO Laws
Prohibiting the participation in the program
and if people can follow
The simple instructions, they are bound to
make some mega bucks
With only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO
THE RECENT INCREASE
OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER
THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable
Opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each
Time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally
joined just to see
What one could expect in return for the
minimal effort and
Money required. To my astonishment, I
received a total of
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still
coming in.""
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.


Here is another testimonial: ""This program
has been around
For a long time but I never believed in it.
But one day when I
Received this again in the mail I decided to
gamble my $25 on
It. I followed the simple instructions and
walaa .. 3 weeks
Later the money started to come in. First
month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I
made a total of $290,000.00
so far, in the past 8 months by re-entering
the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The
key to success in this program
is to follow the simple steps and NOT
change anything. ""More
testimonials later but first,

FUTUREREFERENCE

===============================
===============




If you would like to make at least $500,000
every 4 to 5
months easily and comfortably, please read
the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and
AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION
BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
TRUE,
GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list
below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE
NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING
and YOUR E-
MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the
report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
YOUR
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case
of any mail
problems.

=== When you place your order, make sure
you order each of
the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports so
that you can save
them on your  computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL
COST $5 X 5=$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-
mail, each of the 5
reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your
computer so they  will be accessible for you
to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep them on
your desk in case
something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of
the people who
are listed next to each report, or their
sequence on the list, in
any way other than what is instructed
below in step '' 1
through 6 '' or you will loose the majority of
your profits.
Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see
how it does not work if you change it.
Remember, this
method has been tested, and if you alter, it
will NOT work !!!
People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all
five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not
work this way. Believe us, we all have tried
to be greedy and
then nothing happened. So Do Not try to
change anything
other than what is instructed. Because if
you do, it will not
work for you.

Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports,
take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name &
address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has
made it through the
cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 4 down TO
REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 3 down TO
REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 2 down TO
REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 1 down TO
REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the
REPORT # 1
Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy
every name &
address ACCURATELY!

===============================
=============

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT
MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if
you loose any data.
To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the
5 reports you purchase will provide you with
invaluable
marketing information which includes how
to send bulk e-
mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads
and much more. There are 2 Primary
methods to get this
venture going: METHOD # 1: BY
SENDING BULK E-MAIL
LEGALLY

===============================
=============

Let's say that you decide to start small, just
to see how it goes,
and we will assume You and those
involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that
the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could
be much better but
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many
people will send out
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of
only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out
only 5,000 e-
mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report #
1. Those 10 people responded by sending
out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
50,000 e-mails only
0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered
Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of
500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for
Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 5
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response
to that is 10,000
orders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people
send out 5,000 e-
mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
million) e-mails. The
0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report  # 5.
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5
EACH=$500,000.00
(half million).

Your total income in this example is: 1.....
$50 + 2..... $500 +
3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000
....... Grand
Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL
& PAPER AND
FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND
NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,
YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !

===============================
=============

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS
ASSUMING ONLY 10
PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
MAILED TO.
Dare to think for a moment what would
happen if everyone or
half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000e-mails
each or more? There are over 150 million
people on the
Internet worldwide and counting. Believe
me, many people
will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 :
BY PLACING
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

===============================
=============

Disclaimer: Your earnings and results are highly dependent on your
individual efforts and results. This web page constitutes no guarantees
of any income, whether stated nor implied. Any earnings projections
shown on this website are for example and educational purposes only.
Actual results will vary according to each individual member's activity. In
general, the more you work the plan the better your results.



Advertising on the net is very very
inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads
on the Internet will easily get a larger
response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and
METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you
must do is e-mail
them the Report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same
day service on all orders. This will
guarantee that the e-mail
they send out, with your name and address
on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until
they receive the
report.

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS
============

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS
NUMBER & NAME
ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S.
CURRENCY) for
each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed
by wrapping it in at
least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those
sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report
you are ordering,
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name
and postal
address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS
GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your
success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders
for Report #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2
to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If
you did not, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you
do.

=== Once you have received 100 or more

THIS IS
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are
placed in front of a Different report. You can
KEEP TRACK
of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-
MAILS AND
START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO
LIMIT to the income you can generate
from this business !!!

===============================
=============

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE
ORIGINATOR OF
THIS PROGRAM: You have just received
information that
can give you financial freedom for the rest
of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks
and months than you
have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any
way. It works
exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting
report after you
have put your name and address in Report
#1 and moved
others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed
above. One of the people
you send this to may send out 100,000 or
more e-mails and
your name will be on every one of them.

Remember though, the more you send out
the more potential
customer you will reach. So my friend, I
have given you the
ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU
NOW !

======== MORE TESTIMONIALS
============

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I
live in Chicago. I
am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received this
program I grumbled
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made
fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't
work. Jody totally
ignored my supposed intelligence and few
days later she
jumped in with both feet. I made merciless
fun of her, and was
ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her
when the thing didn't
work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3
weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all
cash! I was
shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
Mitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois

===============================
===========

''Not being the gambling type, it took me
several weeks to
make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative
that I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that
there was just no way that I wouldn't get
enough orders to at
least get my money back''. '' I  was
surprised when I found my
medium size post office box  crammed with
orders. I made
$319,210.00in the first 12 weeks.  The nice
thing about this
deal is that it does not matter where 
people live. There simply
isn't a better investment with a faster return
and so big."" Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

===============================
============

''I had received this program before. I
deleted it, but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of
course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so
I had to wait until I
was e-mailed again by someone
else.........11 months passed
then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made
more than $490,000 on my first try and all
the money came
within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New
York, N.Y.

===============================
=============

''It really is a great opportunity to make
relatively easy money
with little cost to you. I followed the simple
instructions

carefully and within 10 days the money
started to come in. My
first month I made $20,560.00 and by the
end of third month
my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life
is beautiful, Thanks
to the internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport,

Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

<BR>Every day of the week, I get questions from people all  
 <BR>over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 <BR>wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 <BR>to my on-going internet success.
 <BR>
 <BR>Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 <BR>*true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 <BR>become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 <BR>Net or off.
 <BR>
 <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 <BR>consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", 
 <BR>I have to blush & say ...
 <BR>
 <BR>Persistence and personality.
 <BR>
 <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 <BR>
 <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 <BR>It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 <BR>
 <BR>One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 <BR>their online venture, that ""success"" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 <BR>
 <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 <BR>
 <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
<BR>the Bank. Get it!! 
 <BR><a href=""http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb"">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . 
 <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 <BR>online venture a success. 
 <BR>
 <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 <BR>""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 <BR>agree with him more.
 <BR>
 <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 <BR>
 <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 <BR>
 <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 <BR>which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 <BR>
 <BR>Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 <BR>
 <BR>That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 <BR>
 <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!

<BR>----------------------------
<BR>Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!
<BR> Jeff and Rebecca Marks <a href=""http://www.grand-champion.com"">http://www.grand-champion.com</a>
<P>-------------------------------------------------
<BR>Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
<BR>Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
<BR>Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

 <BR>over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 <BR>wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 <BR>to my on-going internet success.
 <BR>
 <BR>Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 <BR>*true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 <BR>become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 <BR>Net or off.
 <BR>
 <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 <BR>consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", 
 <BR>I have to blush & say ...
 <BR>
 <BR>Persistence and personality.
 <BR>
 <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 <BR>
 <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 <BR>It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 <BR>
 <BR>One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 <BR>their online venture, that ""success"" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 <BR>
 <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 <BR>
 <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
<BR>the Bank. Get it!! 
 <BR><a href=""http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb"">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . 
 <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 <BR>online venture a success. 
 <BR>
 <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 <BR>""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 <BR>agree with him more.
 <BR>
 <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 <BR>
 <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 <BR>
 <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 <BR>which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 <BR>
 <BR>Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 <BR>
 <BR>That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 <BR>
 <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!

<BR>----------------------------
<BR>Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

<P>-------------------------------------------------
<BR>Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
<BR>Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
<BR>Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

My name is Wayne Harrison and I would like to share a
genuine, NO RISK opportunity with you.

What I have to share with you is not like any other internet

""get rich quick"" scheme, but rather a credible
and realistic way to save money and gradually develop
what can become a large, recurring residual income.

What's the best thing about this opportunity?
You can ""try it before you buy it"". That's right.
You can join the DHS Club for FREE with no risk

657,1.0,"Certain chances only come around every few
decades or so. This is one. Why you ask?

Because home loan rates are headed up.

Have you locked in the lowest rate, in almost
thirty years, for your present home loan?

Rates haven't been this low in a long time. They
may well never be this low again. This is your
chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why wouldn't you jump at this chance?

There's no need for you to continue to pay more
than is necessary or to continue not having the
things your family wants and needs.
  
We're a nationwide mortgage lender. We're N0T a
broker. And we can guarantee you the best rate
and the best deal possible for you. But only
if you take action today.
 
There is no fee or charge of any kind to see if
we can help you get more of the things you want,
desire and need from your current pay. You can
easily determine if we can help you in just a few
short minutes. We only provide information in
terms so simple that anyone can understand them.
You won't need to be a lawyer to see the savings,
this we promise.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it. And once again, there's no risk for you. None
at all. 

Take a couple of minutes and use the link below
that works for you. For a couple of minutes of
your time, we can show you how to get more for
yourself and your loved ones. Don't lose this
chance. Please take action now.

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.

1. Navigation System

Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.

It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:

- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.

2. Color Scheme

When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.

A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""

3. Content Window

This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.

Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.

To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.

4. Font(s)

Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)

Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.

The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.

5. Advertising

Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.

New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)

Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.

    Conclusion

These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email

""Just because we're working online doesn't mean we should forget

<br>identical design. This is often because webmasters do not
<br>have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.
<br>These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind
<br>design for your website.
<p>1. Navigation System
<p>Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
<br>things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
<br>usually look for a way to get to the information they want
<br>before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
<br>navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase
<br>(<a href=""http://www.webmasterbase.com"">http://www.webmasterbase.com</a>)
for example. There is a list
<br>of categories on the left, and information about the network
<br>on the top bar.
<p>It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
<br>bottom of the page because:
<p>- People see the top of the page first
<br>- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the
visitor.
<p>2. Color Scheme
<p>When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.
<br>For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.
<br>Some colors that are often used are white on black or black
<br>on white.
<p>A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color
<br>Schemer (<a href=""http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/"">http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/</a>),
<br>created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that
<br>can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on
<br>FreewareFiles (<a href=""http://www.freewarefiles.com"">http://www.freewarefiles.com</a>),
Tucows
<br>(<a href=""http://www.tucows.com"">http://www.tucows.com</a>), or Download.com
<br>(<a href=""http://www.download.com"">http://www.download.com</a>) for
""color schemer.""
<p>3. Content Window
<p>This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text
<br>here is easy to read and understand.
<p>Also, provide your own original content. People do not want
<br>to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear
<br>what <i>you</i> want to say! While it might be time consuming to
<br>write your own content, it sure is worth it.
<p>To find content for your website, try searching at
<br>EzineArticles (<a href=""http://www.ezinearticles.com"">http://www.ezinearticles.com</a>).
Other people
<br>may have used the articles, but if you become good friends
<br>with the authors, they may send you new content as they
<br>write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content
<br>from other authors, as mentioned above.
<p>4. Font(s)
<p>Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
<br>fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
<br>Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)
<p>Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
<br>Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can
<br>be used for long pieces of text.
<p>The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
<br>or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
<br>(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
<br>is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
<br>its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making
<br>it easier to read.
<p>5. Advertising
<p>Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing
<br>that almost every website has. The most common type is
<br>what is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that
<br>because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long
<br>you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.
<p>New sizes however are being used. Take for example the
<br>new style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it
<br>looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not
<br>too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)
<p>Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners
<br>used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the
<br>page.&nbsp; Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in
<br>the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.

So, my name is Oksana Svetlova, I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.

I have an idea, how we could cooperate to mutual benefit, see,

Russia, who will be happy to do a web designer's work for you for
considerably less, than you possibly take from your clients (or 
pay for web-design?), and with _professional_ quality. Also - all
programming, Internet-programming, graphic, flash design, content
writing, translations, etc. If you do web-design, then you may
accept more orders at once, getting a good share from each, and
devote yourself only to that work, you find most interesting.
Alternatively, you can realize more your ideas to develop, more
features to add to your existing sites, and with low costs: from
$12, and an average of $18 an hour.

I have put links to their works at www.antee.com/samples_and_faq.html

As for reliability, I just saw, how carefully they hand-picked their
specialists, and under what tight management they do their projects.
So, from past experience, it was almost always possible to meet 
deadlines. Also, communication is properly thought-out: a consultant 
is online in ICQ and other instant messengers almost each day, also 
their company has local consultants in many states throughout the 
USA, in Europe and Australia.

So, what do you think? A possibility for cooperation?

Thank you very much,
Oksana Svetlova.

know a bit of details, they will return you a cost/time estimation.

Dear Sir.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.

I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.

We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 

If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.

Yours faithfully,

DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------=20
=20
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
=20
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
-=20
known locally as The English Season.=20

Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
=20
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
=20


  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
tool?

Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
=20
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?

We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?

We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
=20
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.

We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
l=20
like to be involved in such a decision.=20


  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?

Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
This is our rule and frame of investment.


  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?

Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
-
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
magazine of all kinds).=20

Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
=20
similar status, but differing interests.=20


  Please describe one of your sponsorships

The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
y=20
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
=20
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
=20
king of sports.


  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?

Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
getting a good return on our investment.


  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?

Hi,

You most likely have seen or heard about 
""The Letter"" $5.00 Paypal Program"" that has been seen lately 
on 20/20 and OPRAH WINFREY...etc... How would you like 
to generate more income through a different avenue? What 
if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another 
program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 
There 
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!

THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH 
YOU 
IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!

Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest
to you! Please read all of this. This is not something 
that I would normally look at, except that I read an 
article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about 
PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it 
would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had
already experienced their efficiency and good standing. 
You can complete this whole process in one hour and you 
will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! 
Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the 
Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on the
Internet by E-mail.

NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from
individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a 
little of their time.

TESTIMONIALS FROM:

Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:
Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of
our frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 
grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run 
this program again........

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to
you... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said 
and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was 
up to over $12,000! I owe you!

GETTING STARTED.

If you're not already a user, the very first thing you
need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes 
and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this 
program FREE!

Here's the link:

https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com

BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO 
$100 
DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!

Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) 
to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note
like ""Please add me to your mailing list."" BE PREPARED TO GET
EXCITED.... YOU 
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the 
others 
to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No 
printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US 
Postal and 
Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, 
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal 
Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a 
product or service must be exchanged for money received). 

Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this 
THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much
faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY 
HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see 
results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT 
MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). Ideally, you should
send them to people who send their programs to you or to 
personal contacts who are already working on the web, 
because they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! Besides, this program is 
MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already 
in 
another program, stay with it, but do
yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! 

It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long 
before others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE 
person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET 
WHEN 
YOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have 
a 
PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 
GIFT 
to
the person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list 
at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow 
the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 
in your bank account!

Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT 
POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 
transaction that you get from PayPal!!!

Follow These Simple Instructions: 

E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST 
name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying 
""subscribe me to your mailing list"". Only the first 
person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. 

Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the 
other 
two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first 
place 
in order to earn money fast! 
If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-
mail to then your name will be immediately removed
from the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if 
you add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of 
people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! 

NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in 
the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. 
Send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.

ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the 
response 
time is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! 

Consider this! Millions of people surf the Internet
everyday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people 
to start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move 
the other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own 
e-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is 
associated 
with your PayPal account.

*************************************

There are fifty thousand new people who get on the
Internet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses 
is the people who send you offers by email.
The source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to
think of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I 
say 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's 
so easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!
To send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE
and paste it in the message of your E-mail. 

TO DO THIS:
1. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and ""select all""
2. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and select ""copy""
3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure
it's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)
4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box
5. Go to ""edit"" and ""paste"" (Then you can format it
anyway you want!)


Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the
top name, adding your name and address to the bottom 
of the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, 
YOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT 
forget 
to send $5.00 via PayPal (along 
with your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL
address before deleting it!

NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in
this e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal 
referring URL;


https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com


THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.
When your name reaches the first position in a few
days, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!
The money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people
like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to 
receive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a 
total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) 
in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is 
real money that you can spend on anything you wish!
Just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it 
directly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that 
easy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?

GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?

IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF
COURSE YOU CAN---

This plan is structured for everyone to send only 20
letters each. However, you are certainly not limited 
to 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters 
you send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can 
E-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! 
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run 
this 
program, just follow steps 1
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! 
Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no 
mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the 
printer or copier, and you can do it again and again 
with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up 
a new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the 
list. This is proof that you paid to get put on the 
list which is the service rendered to make all this 
legal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive 
an MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will 
climb to the number one position at dizzying rates. 
Follow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE 
PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. 
Your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list 
WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats 
the other people who have worked hard and have earned the 
right to be there. So please, play by the rules and the 
$$$ will come to you!
$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will 
prosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, 
especially with all the different programs out there 
on the web, but if you don't try this you will 
never know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!
I've been watching this type of program for years and
this is about as easy and fast as you can get it and 
it can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, 
no envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort 
and faith!!! This program really ""Keeps It Short and Simple""! 

OH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link 
under your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...
so they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when 
someone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! 
Let's all make some serious money

you pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's No.1 online 
payment 
service - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay T auctions and thousands 
and 
thousands of online shops. You can also use PayPal to 
pay your friends - example; it's a convenient way to 
split the phone bill with your roommate, send cash to your kids in 
college,or 
send cash to someone in another country. Better yet, you can also 
earn $5 while you do it. Each time someone signs up for an account and 
completes the Refer-a-Friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 BONUS! 
When 
you send money through Pay Pal, you can fund your payments with your 
credit 
card or checking account. You won't have to worry about your privacy, 
because 
PayPal keeps your accounting information safe. Making a purchase with 
PayPal

a 
stranger. That's why over 9 million people from around the world use 
PayPal 
to move money.
Signing up for a PayPal account is easy. It takes only
a couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus 
requirements PayPal will automatically add $5 to your 
account balance. To learn more about PayPal visit the

684,1.0," Generate your own leads using ground-breaking Roth conversion
postcards.	
 	
  _____  

Every senior wants to hear about the roth conversion if you can
eliminate the up front tax cost. You can with the new and improved roth
conversion program from GSL Advisory. 

The cheapest and most successful way to generate roth conversion program
leads is to send postcards while also placing an ad in the small local
paper. Repeat the ads and the postcard mailing at least 6 different
times.

The one truth in advertising is that repetition works. Even the smallest
and most unassuming ad works if it is seen several times. See if you can
find an area that has its own zip code and a local paper serving that
area. Some retirement communities have both a newspaper and their own
zip code.

This is your gold mine.

To see the postcard and ad and to learn how to work the system, complete
the form below which will direct you to the post card and how to make it
work for you.

========================================================
Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:

To whom it may concern,

I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?

Sincerely,

RJ

Location: Midwest, U.S.A.

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

-- Frankie R.

Location: West Coast, USA

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

Finally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive. (Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and sweetness is never acquired inexpensively.  Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craft.  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM). Four or five draws of your pipe.as is the magical way.lingers for a good, goodly while!!!  (An herb pipe and usage instructions are included with each Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) Package.)

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

Equivalence Tablets & Dragon Wing Spray Remedials are comprised of entirely natural botanical factors.

Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program

=22...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework,=20Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups,=20Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material,=20Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable=20production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World=20Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local=20resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)

714,1.0,">>From the Desk of Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria,
 
Lagos-Nigeria.
 
 
 
ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
 
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
 
 
Dear Sir,
 
I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchange
at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. 
 
I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 
 
We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.
 

 
Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. 
 
Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund.
 
We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 
20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business.
 

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  

To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. 
 
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
 
 
 
Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria.

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.

This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.

Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:

a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 

All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  

WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 

So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.

The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.

Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!

If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!

Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youll know if its right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  

Join a small number of people who are reaping the BIG 
REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!

========================================================
Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:

To whom it may concern,

I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?

Sincerely,

RJ

Location: Midwest, U.S.A.

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

-- Frankie R.

Location: West Coast, USA

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

Location: United Kingdom
========================================================
Finally, we realize of course that this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive. (Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and sweetness is never acquired inexpensively.  Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craft.  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM). Four or five draws of your pipe.as is the magical way.lingers for a good, goodly while!!!  (An herb pipe and usage instructions are included with each Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) Package.)

Extreme Martial Arts Botanical Remedies

Eastern culture has long had a treatment for bone, muscle, tendon, ligament, sinew and joint distress, traumas, afflictions and constrictions.  We are pleased to offer 

  Equivalence Tablets  &  Dragon Wing Remedy Spray
    (Hei Ping Shun)           (Hei Long Chibang)

PLEASE NOTE:

While it is true that all physiological traumas and injuries are unique and that no product can arbitrarily eliminate all of the pain and discomfort in all people all of the time, the combination of Equivalence Tablets (Hei Ping Shun) and Dragon Wing Remedy (Hei Long Chibang) remedial botanicals does guarantee to at the least:

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

2.  Significantly increase mobility and strength ratio.
(Please remember also the significance of proper diet, excercise, rest and prayer.)

"
731,1.0," Your Shop Web Site is 
NOT Being SEEN
WHY? 
NO ONE CAN FIND IT!

YOUR web site is NOT on many search engines and at the Bottom of their listings and as a result

YOU are LOSING customers who cannot find you!

Can this be changed? YES!
Regal Telecom

We will submit your web site to over 350 of the worlds search engines.
(see full list of Search Engines at the end of this document)

So YOUR web site can be
FOUND and SEEN

For Twelve Months! Guaranteed! 

 (See our testimonials)


Think about it!
Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site. 
Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!


 A Shocking Fact!
Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.

Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.

You have to be put there!

What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""

You need a professional company to do it!

Your Money Back
Guarantee! 
If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!

There is nothing to lose!


Some testimonials of those that have used

""This service is my secret weapon. I never believed it was possible to have such a rapid response."" etvcom.tv

We are looking forward to having the capability to do online video conferencing and online diagnosis with our patients from many parts of the world. It is a real advantage to have the capabilities that

Button and we can begin submitting your web site to the worlds search engines today!
Then be ready for the response!

Within 24 hours your web site will begin to be submitted to over 350 search engines world wide and every month
 thereafter for the next year.

The results will astound you!

Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below!
This is to YOUR Advantage!


Web Site Facts
Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule! 
 A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.

What does it take to be seen on the 
Search Engines?

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
Use the right ones and you go up.
Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 

It is essential to be on them!

Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
 This can make the difference between new customers 
FINDING your web site or NOT!

YOU CAN MAKE A SEA OF DIFFERENCE

The non-profit Foundation for the Advancement of Marine Sciences (FAMS)
is dedicated to educating children and teaching teachers about the diverse
aspects of marine life, marine activities and how the marine environment
affects essentially all life on Earth.

FAMS offers hands-on, interactive marine science educational programs
designed to foster critical thinking about the complex yet delicate systems
that make up the Earths oceans.

FAMS has developed a funding program for Biology instructors so they can
assist students in raising money to attend the camp, and in raising funds
so the instructor can travel free to the camp.

WE HOPE YOU SHARE FAMS VISION BECAUSE WE NEED YOUR HELP.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

Get involved and show your support for FAMS. As a not-for-profit entity,
FAMS needs your help. Your donation will be used to maintain this very
worthwhile cause. A financial contribution, donated land, boat or car

*********************************
AQUEOUS KATHMANDU
*********************************

For those who choose not to smoke ... we have something for you.  Introducing Aqueous Kathmandu ""Happy Drops"" (tm).

Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops....(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety)....Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu....a.k.a. ""Secret Fire""....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene.... Who du the Kathmandu?  Now....everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive""; happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! 

As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  Finally; we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a ""Sensitive"" herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops, Temple ""Quantum"" Variety, a.k.a....""Secret Fire"".  ""Secret fire""....indeed!!!

This liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....
1) The ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, ""sensitive/responsive"" pipe-smoking product.
2) The ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (Please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  In the instance of Aqueous Kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.
3) A most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more ""absolute""; in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of ""Smoke"" possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that ""Smoke"" is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively
4) Therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a ""Smoke"" and a ""non-Smoke""....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  Each ""impeccable"" singularly.... And at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops and the more traditional Temple ""3"" Ragga Dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting ""camaraderie"". (Please refer to, ""Introductory Offers"".) 

* No need to smoke.  No carcinogenic factors!
* Absolutely legal!  No prescription required!
* Does not include cannibis or any tobacco variety.
* Marvelously potent.  Remarkably substantial!
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity!
* Adjusts attitude & mood enhancement. Relaxes stress & anxiety.
* Better than Kava Kava, St. John's Wort, etc.  Similar to but variant from Ragga Dagga.
* Certainly safer than pharmaceuticals!
* Many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives!
* Better sleeping ... better dreaming.
* Non-invasive ... no downside.
* An exquisite compliment with Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (tm) -- (See Intro Offers)
* Quite simply ... it is a Superior product!

Contents: Aqueous Kathmandu is a unique botanical substantiality.  It is offered and marketed as such.  Undisputedly, it achieves ""distinctive accolade"" of its own merit....  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled or regulated or harmful herbs or cannabis factors.  However, it is our mandatory ethical policy that Aqueous Kathmandu not be offered to individuals who have not yet attained at least 21 years of age (all things in their time....).  Please note as well that Aqueous Kathmandu is not intended for usage during work or while driving.  And, as is true of all substance and indulgence, this product should not be enjoyed during pregnancy.  This proprietary formulation does include the following quantum-ratio, core-extracted/refined botanicals in an alcohol base as a preservative: Albizzia flower-tops, Drachsha, Chavana Prash, Lactuca Virosa, Hybrid Flowering Turnera Diffusa, Wild Dagga, Capillaris Herba, Angelica Root, Zizyphi Spinosae, Buplerum, Hybrid Valeriana officinalis Root, Albizzia flower-tops, mature Polygonum Vine, Calea Zacatechichi, Crocus Sativa flower-tops, Leonorus Sibricus buds, Cinnabaris, Margarita herba, Biotae Orientalis, Salviae Miltiorrhizae....

**************************
STONEY MAHONEY
**************************

In regard to the introduction of Stoney Mahoney (tm) ""personal choice"" smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate ""Sensitive/Responsive"" (loose-leaf) smoking product, ""Amsterdam Cup"" style so to speak!

With acquired knowledge via the development of such notable ""personal choice"" smokeables, as Wizard Smoke (tm), Dream Smoke (tm), Dragon Smoke (tm), Vajroli Mudra (tm), Stashish (tm), ShemHampHorash (tm), Yerba lena Yesca (tm), Weedé (tm), Kathmandu Temple Kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty ""personal choice"" smoking status of our premier Ragga Dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  

After all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded Ragga Dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  Mostly, we were right about this, as this new Stoney Mahoney ""agenda"" is not so much significant as in ""better"", but ""Signature Significant"" as in ""uniqueness,"" in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare ""true-brid"" variety of Artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into ""Absinthe,"" a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  As well, we have finally perfected our exclusive ""kiffening"" technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  Hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly ""potentiated"" Stoney Mahoney (tm) smoking product! Loose-leaf ""personal choice"" doesnt get any ""sweeter"" than this!  

And for all of you Ragga Dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnt so much that Stoney Mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the Ragga Dagga solid-format.  Moreover, it is that Stoney Mahoney is effective in a much different way than Ragga Dagga.  Sort of like apples and oranges, like Panamanian and Jamaican, like Indica and Sativa, if you will!  Within our test marketing, even traditional ""Kind Bud"" aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this Stoney Mahoney jester variety.  Most folks say that Ragga Dagga motivates them in an up ""Sativa"" sort of way, and that Stoney Mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a ""soma,"" Indica sort of way.  If Stoney Mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme ""kiffening"" of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  It is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  As is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of Stoney Mahoneys draw.  

* Indica oriented.
* Definitely happy smoking!
* Mood enhancer.
* Smokeable & brewable mood food!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.
* Sleep deep -- Good-bye funky dreams!
* Hornier than horny goatweed!
* Superlative mixer with Ragga Dagga and/or Aqueous Kathmandu.
* Roll it or bowl it or brew it ...
* Just a pinch goes a long, long way ...
* Possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.
* Non-invasive.
* Absolutely Legal!
* Rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.

Attention! Attention! We have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both Ragga Dagga and Stoney Mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes Ragga Dagga, Stoney Mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our Aqueous Kathmandu Happiness Drops (these are pretty special!).  And to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  A tea for thee.)

Please Note:  Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, ""Personal Choice,"" loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  No included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  There is no tobacco in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  There is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  And although we are not age-governed by law, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  As well, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.

Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm), factored in an Absinthium Labyrinthine Configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, ""Sensitive/Responsive,"" Smoking and/or Brewing Herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.

As is an herbalists way, three or four draws of Smoke should be inhaled and retained.  For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (Steep approximately one tea-spoon of Stoney Mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  When smoking Stoney Mahoney, please draw gently as Stoney Mahoney is a most preeminent ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (Water-pipe is included with each package of Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety).)

Stoney Mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: Dutch Lactuca virosa, Bulgarian Artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Chinese Valeriana ceae, Jamaican Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus boldo, and European (flowering-tops only) Sarothamnus Scoparius. Stoney Mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Stoney Mahoney does indeed achieve distinction upon its own merit....

I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom.

Try it. Just for fun. It will cost you 25$ to earn at least thousands of =
dollars !!! This thing=20
is legal because you are buying and selling something of value: marketing=
 reports.
=A0
There is MY true story.
=A0
I received by email the instructions include in this letter. It interests=
 me because the=20
system was quite simple. In the list of people selling the reports (as yo=
u will see above),=20
there was a guy living not so far. I searched for his phone number and I =
called him. I just=20
wanted to know if this system was really working. He told me his business=
 was going=20
very well and he was receiving from 50$ to 150$ in CASH everyday! That's =
why I went=20
into this thing!
=A0

BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
=A0
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter yo=
u have been hearing=20
about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Int=
ernet, a national=20
weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation =
of this program=20
described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also=
 investigated=20
whether or not the program was legal.
=A0
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Law=
s prohibiting the=20
participation in the program and if people can ""follow the simple instruc=
tion"" they are=20
bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.

=A0
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE=20
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON=20
THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR=20
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
=A0
=3D=3D=3DWHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE =3D=3D=3D
=3D=3D=3DYOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! =3D=3D=3D
=A0
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer an=
d resell them.=20
=A0
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 =3D $25.00.
=A0
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports fro=
m these 5 different=20
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for yo=
u to send to the=20
1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of the=
se reports and=20
keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.
=A0
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to e=
ach report,=20
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed b=
elow in step '' 1=20
through 6 '' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits. Once =
you understand the=20
way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it.=20
=A0
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT w=
ork!!! People=20
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they=
 could get all the=20
money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be g=
reedy and then=20
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is ins=
tructed.=20
Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the =
reward!!!=20
=A0
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and ge=
tting paid for it.=20
Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of tim=
e.
=A0
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REM=
OVE the name=20

e cycle and=20
is no doubt counting their fortune.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
=A0
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
=A0
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critic=
al=20
to YOUR success.
=A0
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on =
your computer. DO=20
NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
=A0
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist=
 you with=20
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will =
provide you with=20
invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails =
legally, where=20
to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 prima=
ry methods to=20
get this venture going:
=A0
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=A0
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we=
 will assume You=20
and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume th=
at the mailing=20
receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much bet=
ter but lets=20
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thou=
sands e-mails=20
instead of only 5,000 each).
=A0
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2=
% response,=20
that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sendi=
ng out 5,000 e-
mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% re=
sponded with=20
orders. That's=3D100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.
=A0
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mai=
ls. The 0.2%=20
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
=A0
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail =
sent out. The=20
0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
=A0
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000=
(50 million) e-
mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.=20
=A0
=A0
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH =3D $500,000.00 (half a million dolla=
rs).
=A0
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5=
,000 + 4.....=20
$50,000 + 5.... $500,000 ....=20
Grand Total =3D $555,550.00
=A0
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST=20
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL=20
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=A0
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF=20
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if ever=
yone or=20
half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?
=A0
There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting,=
 with thousands=20
more coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that,=
 and more!
=A0
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
=A0
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds o=
f FREE places=20
to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a=
 larger response. We=20
strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go al=
ong. For=20
every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they orde=
red. That's it.=20
Always provide same day service on all orders.
=A0
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and add=
ress on it, will=20
be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.
=A0
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D AVAILABLE REPORTS =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wron=
g"". It is simply=20
about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, et=
c. Concealing it=20
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it b=
efore it gets to=20
you.
=A0
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5=20
cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the =
cash is=20
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those s=

Email:edum@hkem.com. 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal 
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the Southern African region of the African continent. 
The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA 
government of my country.The rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently 
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. 
Needles to say I was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.The result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This 
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in South Africa. I 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to 
take possession of the money that I kept with them. 
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola 
(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.Please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
Yours truly, 
Eduado de Mello

769,1.0,"FROM THE DESK OF:DR.OLUFEMI COKER,
ECONOMIC RECOVERY COMMITTEE,
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, 
LAGOS-NIGERIA.

						
FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$ 22.5 M (TWENTY TWO
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)
& BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP.

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division.

 I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe
(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government of
Nigeria to review contracts awarded  by the past
military administration.

In the course of our work at the ERC, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts  by top government officials of  the last
administration. The companies that executed the
contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
commissioned leaving the sum of US$22.5 Million
floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of
Nigeria  ready for payment.

I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$22.5M
legally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your
company. This is bearing in mind that our  civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning 
foreign company or running  foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account:
(1) 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 5% has been set aside as an abstract projection
for reimbursment to both parties for incidental
expences that may be incurred in the course of the
transaction.
(3) 70% to us the government officials (with  which we
wish to commence an importation business in
conjunction with you ). 
 
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction 
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information:  Your  full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely  based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is
going to be made in your name.Please acknowledge the
receipt of this letter  using my personal E-mail
address.

Yours Faithfully, 

DR.OLUFEMI COKER.

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

Hello ~name~,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.

"
783,1.0,"DEAR SIR,

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.

No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.

Best personal regards,

MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or
placed by you or under your control:
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has
condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the
DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for
Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an
alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France-
Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to
countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by
representatives of either nation.""
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early
1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall
Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled
the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has
disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of
2/1/00)
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of
false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom
of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a
serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how
distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of
my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am
obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully
offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your
text will be set off (with ""**"") in color:
**DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti.**
(Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall
Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in
which case a reader may be misled.)
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern
Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific.
**However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent
assertions"" of two organizations, ...**
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the
'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true?
Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been
internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud,
abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every
financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to
serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for
the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign
invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their
own corrupt government?)
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the
Marshallese name for Wake Island),...**
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for
DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister
nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is
not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a
deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the
sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and
irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources
anymore?)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and
the same could be said for DOM.
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged
investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.**
(Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people
of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands
and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for
perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse""
has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands
government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not
now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have
tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources
for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also
will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are
currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have
in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate
entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists
use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't
anybody check sources anymore?)
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries
against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of
either nation.**
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of
which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published
information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against
acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of...""
nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that
effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any
RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the
credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral
sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the
Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his
will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will
happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of
lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and
they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their
jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.)
**A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the
early 1990s.**
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu
in the early 1990s.)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and
6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount
Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and
was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign
state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King
over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established
government as a limited constitutional monarchy.
**It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands
paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf.**
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted
brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the
post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a
Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific
instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from
Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the
people's behalf.
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and
ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.**
(Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The
Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special
Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of
EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no
political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of
Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not
incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was
it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of
any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any
statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.)
Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more
research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion
of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before
arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you
to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents
mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace')
and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site.
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected
elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above
in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the
author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio'
correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request
for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author
regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio.
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet
can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December
10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation
once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According
to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was
leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of
EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims
the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands.""
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article
of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00)
Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press
release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under
a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an
act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal
authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall
Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to
publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a
suitable land base for its people to administer their form of
government.
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day
of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a
state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our
governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had
nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert
Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not
convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence.
This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of
landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to
Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount
Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction.
Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by
Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios.
Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter
case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of
Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr.
Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998,
the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of
the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll
(a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names).
For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in-
cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a
completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign
of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive
intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your
journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be
proved accurate.
I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment
and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric
history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named
by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and
missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the
public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and
most of which are referenced or published at our official web address:
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be
added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from
one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00).
""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the
Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a
U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for
recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and
pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.
The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests
took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the
illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of
the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of
an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's
independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after
the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as
Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American
businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls,
which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.""
Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward
facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet
since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced
text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very
serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke,
which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your
summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios
and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line
by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off
(with ""**"") in color:
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall
Islands of the western Pacific.**
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western
explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in
Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean.
The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the
role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory.""
**After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional
chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part
of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll,
called Enenkio locally.**
Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific,
which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of
the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well
established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and,
having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese
invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak
atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands
of Eneen-Kio Atoll.
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions
here.""
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.**
Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the
Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its
move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional
landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios.
The Author responds: ""I will note this.""
**The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993
acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment
by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.**
Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after
precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged
the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of
Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the
following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People.
**King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the
northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.**
Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death
in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994,
whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited
constitutional monarchy.
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here.""
**The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained
its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary
in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore
land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared
the Dominion of Melchizedek.**
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his
brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today.
To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have
nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since
HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak
atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10
atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story,
which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have
offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct
your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our
pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and
interest in this matter.
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's
Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources
& Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I
will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response,
Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the
next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background:
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the
Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0
(discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar,
Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His
Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or
state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the
said ""press release"" is indeed an official document.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that
representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King
Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right
and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons,
many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall
Islands.
Response to so-called ""Press Release"":
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also
unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an
unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon
Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the
U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report)
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall
Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio:
=C2=BB =C2=BB exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo
Convention (1933).
=C2=BB =C2=BB was conceived as a separate independent state by its
sovereign,
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987.
=C2=BB =C2=BB was established by way of a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many
other
states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek
=C2=BB =C2=BB has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over
islands
and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries.""
=C2=BB =C2=BB exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional
and
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred
heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI
Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak
atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its
political
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and
seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of
Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the
Marshall Islands.
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall
Islands:
=C2=BB =C2=BB also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the
Montevideo
Convention (1933).
=C2=BB =C2=BB was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign
governments,
which included the United States, China and the USSR.
=C2=BB =C2=BB was also established under a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of
anything that is not also public information and no such public
information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has
ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the
islands
and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in
1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any
present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to
the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter.
=C2=BB =C2=BB exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution,
which
does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over
territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio
Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant
matter.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom
of
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the
suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of
Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to
coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap
Hermios.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements
or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility,
existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in
the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication
by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as
deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His
Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of
EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate
responsive measures.
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom
of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following
statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands,
then you decide for yourself:
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace
and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the
aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and
striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal.""
On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom
of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a
free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background:
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on
reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics
and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC,
February 1999, states as follows:
""Where Are OFCs Located?
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction
anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest
OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote
areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere
figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek
(sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in
intent and practice."" [note: OFC =3D Offshore Financial Center]
Response:
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble
citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible
categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an
unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His
Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs
thereof.
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt
to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics
trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels,
terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without
even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate
such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United
States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the
United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the
United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of
power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United
States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional
representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised
of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in
kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of
Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic
cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration
The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of
interests exists between it and the United States Government.=C2=A0 The
United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism,
appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in
""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State,
which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.=C2=A0 The
explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by
agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments
of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many
Marshallese.=C2=A0 Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and
outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not
healed.
Thus a current state of adversity exists.=C2=A0 Following four years of
attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the
Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to
Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese
King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the
world.=C2=A0 The people were displaced from their native lands and kept
as
virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue
of being kept out.=C2=A0 It was through this pragmatic initiative that
the
Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon
the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the
ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios.
In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.=C2=A0
While a
state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past
wrongs remains on the horizon.=C2=A0 The Kingdom of EnenKio does not
condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or
agent of any government.=C2=A0 Such unnecessary means would diminish any
hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the
cause of peace within the family of nations.=C2=A0 The Kingdom of
EnenKio
also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of
the Marshallese people.
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the
U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter,
conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination,
preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses,
it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the
people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.=C2=A0 The refusal
of
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple
discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with
representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity,
turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of
the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute
the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.=C2=A0 Your
understanding is appreciated.=C2=A0

December 19, 1998: News Release
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the
occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio,
His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts
are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999.
Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made
his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of
traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a
family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved.
Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as
Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and
High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as
our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to
be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a
successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be
announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head
of State.
HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as
Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the
Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first
discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a
well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by
force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western
ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and
beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally
occupied by the federal government of the United States.
In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios
clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in
interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio
Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the
Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of
the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official
Internet site.
On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely
grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and
are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be
recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people
by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese
domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has
passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese
ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the
mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best
wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to
all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: Communiqu=C3=A9 to Correspondents
Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have
been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands
government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more
admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for
disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased
report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding
the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are
cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or
concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the
State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply:
The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No
claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any
claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in
the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the
ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of
war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as
an honorable state among nations.
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting
authority over land ...within the geographical and political
boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed
imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of
Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish
there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one
has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue
be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous
weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our
shirtsleeves, our raison d'=C3=AAtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble
to
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site:
http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled
""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was
advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver
licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of
EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary,
our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so
steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are
advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such
an act is patently illegal.
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap
Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I
have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and
ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the
statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its
territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to
their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by
Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney.""
HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the
northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of
his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens
who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and
peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic]
(actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is
the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300
miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker
applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society
writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning
of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the
First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first
pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the
Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997.
First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First
Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time
following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are
encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint
mailing list.
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the
government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution
in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the
island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of
the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended
recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship
are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA
and elsewhere.
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake
Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned
names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people
in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the
atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant
jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and
cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the
government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial
title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at
the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar
fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful
return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by
Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the
Monarchy.
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to
top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a
virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the
blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from
United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to
request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related
factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific
Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the
atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom
have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal
advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events
and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the
world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights
violations by federal agents of the United States government.
INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and
dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium
nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the
basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets
varies according to the value and stability of national currency units,
the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with
any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the
stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be
determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are
printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended
for use as money.
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people
from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of
EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In
doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the
federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with
human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from
the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom
and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top
Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the
United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts
that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF
ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most
recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One
of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a
Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding
the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United
States.
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of
disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the
government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with
similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the
premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and
compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal
action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal
government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal
announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and
failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world
regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by
the United States.
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three
small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for
Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue
is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land
tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal
chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United
States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in
1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple
landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war
missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of
the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a
cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the
East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was
destined to become a military installation.
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President
by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of
correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without
establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the
first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood
from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that
jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not
establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA
(predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base
for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called
annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently
illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.
When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally
significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent
was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake
Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak
chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of
Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall
group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was,
the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at
Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby
activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or
quintessential knowledge by the American public.
Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian
Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there
being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel
Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in
sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder
of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title.
The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from
aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its
Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures
the rights of ownership.
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the
administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration,
""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island
nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or
unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom,
over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that
truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of
power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the
record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are
all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it
comes to seizure of land and denial of rights.
In the Declaration, demands are made as follows:
=C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an
honorable
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."".
=C2=BB =C2=BB ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to
submit to
Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR
reparations to citizens.""
=C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone...""
=C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in
commerce by failure the Department of the Interior
=C2=BB =C2=BB ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more
than
TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a
Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is
obligated to pay.""
=C2=BB =C2=BB That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to
immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating
the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights
and due process..."".
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable
nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the
Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a
peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of
the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly.
Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll,
titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern
atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall
Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe!
The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you
to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to
take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take
appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as
you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy
insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the
federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your
anonymity and that of your publication is well served.
Summary of Events 1993-94:
Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment
of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as
Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two
announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii
said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu
newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island
airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another
military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994;
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama
issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch
program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to
believe.
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was
held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under
the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of
independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as
king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the
first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake
I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant
impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature
into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its
sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership
claims.
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the
nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His
Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr.
Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution,
Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted.
On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into
law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the
USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the
people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent
peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as
owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and
embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of
democratic government.
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world
proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were
presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation
requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United
Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others.
Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request
for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council.
On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent
via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding
the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the
islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued
disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms
of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall
Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged
receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now
in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million.
The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994,
relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent,
only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands
Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then
only briefly.
Request for Media Response:
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural
calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and
deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a
new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an
aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth
of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about
suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the
security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of
""world leadership""? Or is it world domination?
People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an
effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby,
hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of
their ancestral heritage:
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed
invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper
annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized
by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for
at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and
validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a
fabrication.)
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of
specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack
thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my
understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing""
of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war,
technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds
against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop
serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the
king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the
citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their
government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and
fiscal manner.
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of
questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation,
offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research,
environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note:
Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island
and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets
and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less
publicized projects.)
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with
regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by
King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored
and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human
rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and
conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal
to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military
and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology
for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year
and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious
significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio
citizens.)
Parting Shot:
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in
general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow
behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the
right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest
inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an
approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner
of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright
alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent
trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports,
forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and
virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have
escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government.
Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable
thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry
of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a
century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only
be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of
American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and
inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States
by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures
and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from
matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in
determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to
know; the media a responsibility to show them.
In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is
one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political
philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives
for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human
cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual
rights.
Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and
forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands
which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty,
King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister
Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of
Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials
in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing
came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the
illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by
the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899.
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value
and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common
Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King
Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S.
claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human
rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also
establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to
answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand
valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was
made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land.
Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per
month through 1995.
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S.
officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which
keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory
exile.
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a
small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands,
including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal
chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for
religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC.
During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and
explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the
real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the
islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who
recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill
Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy.
King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief
(Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the
Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll.
Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the
islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of
restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most
recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air
Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii.
Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu
Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air
Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much
activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"".
According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private
entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a
stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral
heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people.
Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation
under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate
and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to
direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as
a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive
Council.
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the
effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any
substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers
and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the
recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the
lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios:
=C2=BB =C2=BB Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al
Gore
in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in
their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were
ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more
than a decade ago.
=C2=BB =C2=BB In response to the Environmental Assessment of the
proposed
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of
protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated
launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into
the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered.
=C2=BB =C2=BB Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket
launch
activities and requesting help went unanswered.
=C2=BB =C2=BB A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which
declared the
status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the
administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise
ignored.
After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the
declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United
States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council.
They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied
access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of
Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the
Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government
recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his
family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio .
While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of
foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included
agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of
Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the
past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the
future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace.
Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the
United States.
Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S.
Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President
Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall
Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges
superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of
ownership and use of land.
Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military
might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations
(e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other
Ministers and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully
displace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His
Majesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document
was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up
in International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
In an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the
restoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international
recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the
Sovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent
documents of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations
Security Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations
and to the governments of most other nations of the world.
It is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment
of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and
relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time,
Mr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to
inform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or
by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is
made to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of
EnenKio.

789,1.0,"Dear Sir/Ma, 
I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.

791,1.0,"(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  

Dr. Kataga Bakori
Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002


Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.

Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.

The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.

 the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. 

I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.

Thanks for your co-operation,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Kataga Bakori

NB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1

Hi,

You can make $50,000 or more in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
Seem impossible? Is there a catch?  NO, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.

Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then
people send me CASH in the mail for information that I just e-mail
back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.

Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you
like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.

""AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION""

""Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS
TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following.
This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money.

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home.

The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will
understand once you experience it.

""HERE IT IS BELOW""

*** Print This Now For Future Reference ***

The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in
taking a look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment
($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!!

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.

It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house
except to get the mail.

Simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this
happen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if
you put in the effort to make it work. E-mail is the sales tool of
the future. Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW!

The longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your
business using e-mail. Get what is rightfully yours. Program
yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but
it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief
system in place.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods.
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.

You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work.
The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!""

With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business.

Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others.

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.

My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my
business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened
in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's
prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. All of the programs
I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one
year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!

But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!
After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it
correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.

Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.

I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN
LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT.""

Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am
telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I
promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me.
Here is the basic version of what you need to do:

Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND
OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.

Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2
within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.

Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.
Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT
#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,
1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done.

By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more
than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!

In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,
I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security.

If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke

P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working.

Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945.

I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.

The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor.

As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.""
The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that.

You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK"" and ""JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined.

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them!

Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW!

""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody
Jacobs, Richmond, VA

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.

Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE
FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do it privately in your own home, store, or office.

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do.

1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell
them if you don't have them).

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &
RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).

*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF
ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them.

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

a. Look below for the listing of available reports.

b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement
and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!

c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.

d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3

f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy
and paste method works well,.

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction
portion of this letter.

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet
Connection and e-mail is FREE!

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.

Here are two primary methods of building your downline:

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. Using a good list, the response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order REPORT #2.

Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about
level five!  That's $500,000 alone!

Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that and more!

REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software.

METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.
Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10
downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING
results below:

1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000

THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants.

THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!

AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND
NAME ***

* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of
those sheets of paper include:
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately.

* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the requested product/report.

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?
Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when
they email you, send them this report in response!

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders
for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business!

Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program:

1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO
PRODUCE!

2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP!

3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO
ADVERTISE!

4. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE
WORLD!

5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS
YOUR TIME!

6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS
PURE PROFIT!

7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.

******* TESTIMONIALS*******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm
living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR

My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that
I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer
now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more
years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.

The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in.
-Charles Morris, Esq.

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy
spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Majee

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!

797,1.0,"O'Connor quickly moved his cursor down the left side of the web
page. Then, showing a flash of his silky skills, he cut across to
the right hand side and clicked on Top Ten Special Offers. He zipped
past the Irish Chicken Breast Fillets at 25% off, nipped round the
HB Selections ice cream also at 25% off and went on with the goal
firmly in sight:

  - Budweiser '24 pack 500ml cans'. Was E49.20. Now E42.15. SAVE E7.05*

  - Guinness '24 pack 500ml cans'. Was E50.16. Now E42.33. SAVE E7.83*


With one of his trademark clicks of the mouse he sent his cost-price
cases of beer straight into the back of his online basket.  1 - 0 to
Ireland. From there O'Connor was unstoppable and went on to make it
an unforgettable afternoon as he tucked away another four goals:

  - Pringles Large Tubes 200g. Was E2.05 each. Now buy 2 for E3.00*

  - Hula Hoops Minis Tub 140g. Was E2.42. Now buy one get 2nd half price*

  - Club Twin Packs 2x2 litre. Was E3.10 each.
    Now buy 1 get 2nd half price*

  - Twix 9 pack. Was E1.99. Now buy 1 get 2nd half price*

798,1.0,"If you are a time traveler or alien disguised as human and or have
the technology to travel physically through time I need your help!

My life has been severely tampered with and cursed!!
I have suffered tremendously and am now dying!

I need to be able to:

Travel back in time.

Rewind my life including my age back to 4.

I am in very great danger and need this immediately!

I am aware of two types of time travel one in physical form and 
the other
in energy form where a snapshot of your brain is taken using 
either the
dimensional warp or the carbon copy replica device and then sends 
your consciousness
back through time to part with your younger self. Please explain
how safe and what your method involves.

I have a time machine now, but it has limited abilitys and is 
useless
without
a vortex.

If you can provide information on how to create vortex generator 
or
where I can get some of the blue glowing moon crystals this would 
also
be helpful. I am however concerned with the high level of 
radiation these
crystals give off, if  you could provide a shielding that would be 
great.
I believe the vortex needs to be east-west polarized,
North-south polarized vortexexs are used for cross-dimensional 
time 
travel only.


Only if you have this technology and can help me exactly as 
mentioned
please send me a (SEPARATE) email to: IneedTimeTravel@aol.com

Please do not reply if your an evil alien!
Thanks

         SOLICITING FOR A BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP

Before I proceed.Am greatful to introduce my self, My name is MR ZIMMY MABO a zimbabwean.I was formaly a personal aid to PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE,Due to my position and closeness with the President. I absconded with sum of TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$25,000,000)Which was part of the money meant for campaigning for president Robert Mugabe's re- election into office under Zaunpe party.Presently I have been able to move the funds diplomatically to a security company in the Netherlands. 

MY REQUEST:I am looking for a trustworthy individual or firm to advice me in the right investment as well as to provide account where the funds will be lodge into.Moreso,I am interested in buying propertys for residence as my family will be residing there in the near future.

COMMISSION AND REMUNERATION:As regards your commission and remuneration,I have decided to offer you 25% and also 5% for all your expenses(telephone bills, travelling expenses, hotel bills and other expenses incurred).

NOTE: I shall commit half of my own share of the total sum into a joint venture project preferably in the purchace of real estates or other profitable business venture ,Be rest assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds inquestion belong to me alone, As soon as I get your conset ,I will furnish you with the details and contact of the security company where I have the funds deposited.I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will derive a huge success hereafter and it will be a long lasting business association.


 YOURS TRULY,

The new .NAME domain extension is currently being released to the general public. Unlike the original .COM and .NET domain names, the new .NAME domain was specifically created for individuals such as yourself. The .NAME domain appears in the format: FirstName.LastName.NAME For example, if your name is Monica Smith, then you can register a name such as monica.smith.name Technology experts predict that personalized domain names will soon be used as international identifiers much the same was that phone numbers are used today.

"
823,1.0,"Hi There,

I wanted to spread this good karma to you.

This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.

I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.

I am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.

Please help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!

made 13 sales first week'. That's $13000' this 
is the best program I've done and I've done them all! 

Richard S. Memphis, TN 
  
I did it all with my computer! People sign up like crazy! 
First I said, ok, I am financially totally down, I need to 
give this one a try. But after two weeks I am already out of debt! 
Oh god, I did not expect that! And I am not a sales person and I 
did it! I am so excited, thank you Richard and Mary!

I am SPEECHLESS! With your FREE leads, and FREE 
unsecured Visa MC, I was able to advertise free

hook! I think I'll have 20 sales this month!!! 
I haven't even begun to download all the free 
software to make even more MONEY' Thanks guys 

Randy S. Detroit MI 
  
I was in my chiropractor's office when the secretary 
was about to throw out a fax that they had just received. 
The fax was similar to this email and caught my eye. 
I did exactly what it told me to do (a fax blast) and 
in my second day I made $6,000. No hard selling, no 
hustling my friends, just friendly people looking at 
a great opportunity and wanting in. Even if it took 
me a month to make an extra $5,000 I would have been 
happy, but $6,000 in my second day, wow! I'm excited.

Lagos-Nigeria.

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

potential customers. They are much more likely to

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLY

Simple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,

Ron M. Jenkins

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

Lagos-Nigeria.

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

848,1.0,"Dear Sir,

I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com


Kind regards,

Stanley Woodwork.

"
855,1.0,"Greetings!

If you're thinking about a new job, now's the time to
aggressively pick up your search. Many people slow
their job search donw in summer months when in fact
it's the best time to look!

Here's why.  Many companies implement a new direction
or strategy at the first of the year, resulting in a
first of the year hiring surge. By mid year, with
results in hand, companies start hiring again to
expand on or adjust for the results of their first of
the year plans.

While employers start hiring, job seekers start
slowing their search efforts down. This creates an
optimal job seeking environment of more jobs and less
competition!

To best take advantage of this situation you should give
yourself massive exposure by signing up to all the top
career sites as soon as possible. Of course it will take
a little time, but it's well worth it. The top career
sites are visited by 1.5 million employers and recruiters
daily - And collectively list millions of jobs.

If you want to save 60 hours of research and data entry,
try a service called ResumeRabbit.com.  They instantly
post your resume to 75 the top career sites at once.
You'll find this service at http://start.resumerabbit.com

With this service you fill out one simple form in about
15 minutes and you'll be instantly seen on Monster.com,
HotJobs.com, Job.com CareerBuilder.com, Dice.com and more!

When searching for a new job, it's important to work
smart and cover a lot of ground. Today's serious job
seeker must take a multi-pronged approach to succeed.
This should include networking, reading all the
classifieds, posting your resume on all the top career
sites and searching job listings on these sites daily.

We recommend you try http://start.resumerabbit.com
It's a quality service that delivers what it promises.

>>From mid November to mid January, the holidays have
a ""slowing down"" effect on hiring. Since the job search
process can often be several months, waiting until the
end of summer to get started may push your new job off
well after the new year.  Now's the optimum time to
aggressively mount your search!

Sincerely,


Steve Adler

Our research has found that many online entrepreneurs have
tried one or more of the following...

    Free Classifieds? (Don't work anymore)
    Web Site? (Takes thousands of surfers)
    Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)
    E-Zine? (Hope they have a -huge- subscriber list)

Although often misunderstood, there is one method that has

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's true.
<p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
<br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
<br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
<br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
<p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
<br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
<br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
<br>it is absolutely true.
<p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
<br>not produce results.
<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
<br>Poor sales letters.
<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
<br>your sales letter...
<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
<br>going to read them.
<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
<br>account from the ""real world.""&nbsp; It effectively creates
<br>interest and further establishes the point.
<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
<br>words were, ""It's true.""&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
<br>you've got a winner.
<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
<br>Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
<br>will aid them.
<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
<br>of your ideas.
<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
<br>words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
<br>but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""&nbsp; Leads aren't
<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
<br>what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
<br>""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
<br>Hemingway.
<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
<p>Or this.
<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
<br>force the reader to get distracted.
<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
<br>readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
<br>for&nbsp; me?""&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
<br>reader.
<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
<br>the benefits, not the features.
<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a ""work
<br>at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
<br>5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
<br>5 hours a week.""&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
<br>match made for them.
<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
<br>letters...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
<br>HERE to continue.""
<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
<br>If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
<br>that let the mouse get away.""&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
<br>than a speeding bullet.""&nbsp; ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
<br>""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
<br>word pictures stick in our minds?
<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
<br>services as back-end products.
<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
<br>this anywhere else.""
<p>17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
<br>weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
<br>mind.&nbsp; ""What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?""
<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
<br>think, ""This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
<br>I can expect.""&nbsp; ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
<br>human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
<br>Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
<br>leave no impression whatsoever.""
<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
<br>Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""&nbsp; Then, address that
<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
<br>reader from making the purchase.
<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; ""If these people have
<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
<br>probably will too.""&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
<br>from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
<br>field.
<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
<br>that important.
<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; ""Wouldn't you like to
<br>make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
<br>you like to be as successful as I am?""&nbsp; Avoid any question
<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
<br>feel like they are inferior.
<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
<br>the credibility of your main offer.
<p>25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
<br>and ""But that's not all.""&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
<br>value and benefits to the reader.
<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
<br>""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
<br>bonuses.""&nbsp; ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
<br>I've got to hurry.""&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
<br>system in place.&nbsp; ""Operators are standing by.""&nbsp; Their order
<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
<br>product or service RISK-FREE.
<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
<br>just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""&nbsp; ""Order today!""
<br>""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""&nbsp; You've got them
<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
<br>to ""Act Fast!""&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
<br>way?
<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

<p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
<br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
<br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
<br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
<p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
<br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
<br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
<br>it is absolutely true.
<p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
<br>not produce results.
<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
<br>Poor sales letters.
<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
<br>your sales letter...
<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
<br>going to read them.
<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
<br>account from the ""real world.""&nbsp; It effectively creates
<br>interest and further establishes the point.
<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
<br>words were, ""It's true.""&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
<br>you've got a winner.
<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
<br>Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
<br>will aid them.
<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
<br>of your ideas.
<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
<br>words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
<br>but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""&nbsp; Leads aren't
<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
<br>what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
<br>""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
<br>Hemingway.
<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
<p>Or this.
<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
<br>force the reader to get distracted.
<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
<br>readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
<br>for&nbsp; me?""&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
<br>reader.
<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
<br>the benefits, not the features.
<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a ""work
<br>at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
<br>5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
<br>5 hours a week.""&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
<br>match made for them.
<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
<br>letters...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
<br>HERE to continue.""
<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
<br>If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
<br>that let the mouse get away.""&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
<br>than a speeding bullet.""&nbsp; ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
<br>""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
<br>word pictures stick in our minds?
<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
<br>services as back-end products.
<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
<br>this anywhere else.""
<p>17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
<br>weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
<br>mind.&nbsp; ""What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?""
<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
<br>think, ""This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
<br>I can expect.""&nbsp; ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
<br>human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
<br>Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
<br>leave no impression whatsoever.""
<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
<br>Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""&nbsp; Then, address that
<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
<br>reader from making the purchase.
<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; ""If these people have
<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
<br>probably will too.""&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
<br>from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
<br>field.
<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
<br>that important.
<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; ""Wouldn't you like to
<br>make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
<br>you like to be as successful as I am?""&nbsp; Avoid any question
<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
<br>feel like they are inferior.
<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
<br>the credibility of your main offer.
<p>25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
<br>and ""But that's not all.""&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
<br>value and benefits to the reader.
<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
<br>""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
<br>bonuses.""&nbsp; ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
<br>I've got to hurry.""&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
<br>system in place.&nbsp; ""Operators are standing by.""&nbsp; Their order
<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
<br>product or service RISK-FREE.
<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
<br>just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""&nbsp; ""Order today!""
<br>""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""&nbsp; You've got them
<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
<br>to ""Act Fast!""&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
<br>way?
<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

870,1.0,"20th July, 2002

To:    The President

From:  AB Sanni

Assalam Aleikum,

I wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality.

I am A. B. Sanni, a close confidant to Mohammed Abacha, son of late
General Sani Abacha, former head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria, who
ruled from November 17th 1993 to June 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office.

Since then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments, by security operatives/agents of the new Head of State
(General Obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for
coup offence. Even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured
many times.  Mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. These
offences he knows nothing about, as he was only the Head of State's son,
not even a military man nor was he in the government. 

His father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of Crude Oil Sales as
the Head of State. Now, the family has lost all assets (property and money
in Nigeria) to the new government. Ref. News Watch Magazine publication of
11th to 18th October, 1999. However, they have hidden records in a secret
name with the Nigerian Insurance Deposit Corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million
United States Dollars only ($338,000,000).   Mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that I can not disclose now.

THE AIM OF THIS LETTER IS TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO SECURE THIS
ACCOUNT IN A SAFE/CONFIDENTIAL BANK AND HELP INVEST THE MONEY FOR OUR
MUTUAL BENEFIT. We also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe Country because right now Nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.

If you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email ""a_sanni@email.com"", so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment.  Thereafter we will
sign an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million United
States Dollars only ($338,000,000).

We will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you.

PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE CODED TRUST ACCOUNT YOU
ARE LIKELY TO INCURE EXPENSES BUT IT WILL BE PAID BACK ONCE WE SECURE THE
DEPOSIT.  IT IS 100% SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 
Just forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you.

We look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.

Ma-Salam.

For Mohammed Abacha

Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.  

Opex's usual rates are 4.5 cents per minute for domestic calls, with great international rates, too!

"
879,1.0,"FROM: DR. BEN KOKORI

Compliments of the season.  I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. 

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. 

In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,

BEN KOKORI

886,1.0,"Hello 
THIS E-MAIL AD IS BEING SENT IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. SENATE BILL 1618, TITLE #3, SECTION 301

TO REMOVE YOURSELF SEND A BLANK E-MAIL TO: removal999@yahoo.com
=====================================================================================
YOU ARE GETTING THIS EMAIL BECAUSE YOU ARE ON A LIST OF PEOPLE THAT WANT ALL THE MONEY  THEY  CAN SPEND WITHOUT WORKING FOR IT...YOU WILL ONLY GET THIS ONCE, SO PLEASE DO NOTHING  
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE REMOVED! (By Doing nothing you will automatically be removed )
=====================================================================================

We really are looking for TRULY lazy people that dream about being able to do what they 
want, when they want AND DO SO WITHOUT WORKING.
We want the type of people that drive by a house and say that they want that house some 
day, but would love to own that house through money generated while they sleep or while 
they are on vacation.

We want the type of people that would like to send their children to ""Harvard"" or 
""Stanford"" and have these educations paid for through money generated while they sleep or 
while they are on vacation.

We want the type of people that see a new T-Bird, Corvette or Jaguar and want to own these 
cars and have them paid for through money generated while they sleep or while they are on 
vacation.

We want the type of people that on a whim want to travel to maybe Maui in the winter or 
Alaska in the summer and while there if they choose to buy a home in either place, they can 
do so through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation.

We want the people that would like to sleep till noon if they choose to or get up and go to 
the country club to play golf if they choose to and do so because they always have a stream 
of income through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation.

We want the type of people that truly hate the thought of getting up in the morning and 
making money for some one else.

We want the type of people that deep down want to tell some snob that thinks he's a big 
deal because he or she drives a Mercedes, that the Rolls Royce that you are driving is paid 
for and tomorrow you might buy yourself a Porche and if you are in the mood to, you might 
buy your wife or friend a BMW.  In other words, you deep down want to tell the snobs of the 
world, that they really are managing their debt, but you have what you want when you want 
and you have it all with no debt and you have all of this through money generated while you 
sleep or while you are on vacation.

Seriously, if you want more money than you can spend and you really, truly DO NOT WANT TO 
WORK, then you are the type of person we are looking for.

If you would like to know why some people can do this...then simply send a blank email with 
the words: ""I HATE TO WORK"" in the subject area to:
ihatetowork99@yahoo.com

After doing so, you will be contacted in less than 24 hours and learn how to get the house 
you want, the education for your children that you would like them to have, go on the 
vacation you want, when you want all through money generated while you sleep or while you 
are playing golf or while you are on vacation.

Also, we do not want you to hear from us again if the idea of making all the money you want 
is not exciting to you...therfore this is the first and last email you will get unless we 
hear from you...so if you want TO GET RICH with out working, then simply send a blank email 
with the words: ""I HATE TO WORK"" in the subject area to:
ihatetowork99@yahoo.com
 

Thank you,

""The I hate to work"" associates

Subject:  I don't work...but I have a ton of money!

894,1.0,"GAMING ADVISOR  

NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.      
 
The general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that ""online gambling and sports betting is here to stay. Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. 

Whats more, there are NO competitors for the Companys method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with
Major Casinos Globally.    
 
Michael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations.  The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons. A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.
 
i2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. 

FACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corps common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! 

RECOMMENDATION: STRONG BUY

899,1.0,"NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT

From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.


Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

For more information, please visit out website at

"
907,1.0," Your Shop Web Site is 
NOT Being SEEN
WHY?

YOUR web site is NOT on many search engines and at the Bottom of their listings and as a result

YOU are LOSING customers who cannot find you!

Think about it!
Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site. 
Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!


 A Shocking Fact!
Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.

Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.

You have to be put there!

What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""

You need a professional company to do it!

If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!

There is nothing to lose!

Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below!
This is to YOUR Advantage!


Web Site Facts
Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule! 
 A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.

What does it take to be seen on the 
Search Engines?

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
Use the right ones and you go up.
Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 

It is essential to be on them!

Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
 This can make the difference between new customers 
FINDING your web site or NOT!

910,1.0,"FROM:MR JOE MARK
EMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791
EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.com

DEAR SIR
 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL.
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. 

We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.
Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry 
of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board
appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria to award contracts to individuals and
companies and to approve such contract payments in the
Ministry of Mines and Power. The duties of the
committee also include evaluation, vetting and
monitoring of work done by foreign and local
contractors in the ministry.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 

The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 

However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 

The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.

We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped 
in the circumstances as the civil service code of
conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore
accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction. 

My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not want
to miss this once in a life time opportunity.

You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 

(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 

(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 

(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 

(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of  receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 

Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email
address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into
the
complete picture of the transaction when I have heard
from you. 

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Mr Joe Mark

========================================================
Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:

To whom it may concern,

I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?

Sincerely,

RJ

Location: Midwest, U.S.A.

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

ATTN:ALHAJI

With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
to
Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
the revolution in the country, prominent people were
hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.

Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
money, which he concealed under the roof. He
instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
powerful peace keeping force of the (ECOMOG)
intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
the rebels, which was the order of the day.
Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
at the moment of calamity, and every person was
running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
of property title.

The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
with a private security company in order not to raise
an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
sons name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
money for investment in your country because of
political and economic stability and for future
benefit of my child.


I want you to assist us claim this box from the
security company and get the money into your private
account in your country so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.


Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
the course of the transfer both locally and
externally. For the interest of this business, do not
hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
above e-mail address immediately you
receive this message for more information and to
enable
us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
other person knows about this money apart from my son
and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.

Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.


Best regard,

MRS. REGINA ROSSMAN.

Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program

=22...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework,=20Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups,=20Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material,=20Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable=20production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World=20Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local=20resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)

Free Classifieds? (Don't work)

Search Engines? (Easily buried with thousands of others)

S O    W H A T   D O E S   W O R K ? 

Although often misunderstood, there is one method  that has proven to succeed time-after-time.

E - M A I L M A R K E T I N G ! !

Here's what the experts have to say about E-Mail Marketing:

""A gold mine for those who can take advantage of
mass e-mail programs"" - The New York Times

""E-mail is an incredible lead generation tool""
-Crains Magazine

""Blows away traditional Mailing"" 
- Advertising Age

Here is an example of your potential earnings if you have a product that
brings you a profit of around $30. Remember, on the Internet, you can
make money 7 days a week, 24 hours a day... even while you sleep, 
orders come from all over the world!

THE QUESTION IS... how do you generate those orders?

ABSOLUTE BEST product of its kind anywhere in the world today.  There are NO OTHER products 
ANYWHERE that can compete with the quality of this CD.

O N E   O F   A   K I N D
This CD is a first. No one... and we mean NO ONE is shipping valuable CDs to customers before 
they pay. What is different about this offering? The main difference is all you have to do is email us 
the address to ship the CD to! You don't have to worry about getting ripped off. There is no risk to you.

Test The CD, when you're 100% satisfied that the CD is everything and more than it claims to be - 
then send $49.95 by check. money order or credit card.

Our claim to fame, is that our addresses are deliverable!  The number #1 problem with email lists are 
deliverability. You may have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's or you may have purchased a list in 
the past. Chances are, the list was produced 6 months, 1 year or even two years ago! Not ours, a new 
volume CD comes out every 6-7 weeks. 

Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists:

1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates. 

2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even more. No address with inappropriate or 
profane wording survive! 

3. Then, a special filter file is used to eliminate the ""Web Poisoned"" e-mail addresses from the list. Our
EXCLUSIVE system reduced these ""poison"" addresses to near zero. You may have seen CD's with 30, 40, 
50 million addresses, not only do they contain many undeliverable addresses, but most are notorious for 
millions of these ""poisoned"" email addresses.

4. Next we used our private database of thousands of known ""extremists"" and kicked off every one we could 
find. NOTE:We maintain the world's largest list of individuals and groups that are opposed to any kind of 
commercial e-marketing... they are gone, nuked!

5. All domains have been verified as valid. 

WHAT DID WE END UP WITH?       THE POWERMAN 10 MILLION INTERNET MARKETING SHOP CD

Getting this CD is equivalent to buying EVERY CD sold by almost everyone else, combined... EXCEPT - 
it has been cleaned and the quality is unsurpassed by any list in existence!  With our super clean lists you'll 
send less...and get better results... plus you can start mailing as soon as you receive your CD! 

* Y O U   G E T  W H A T   Y O U   P A Y   F O R *

Our POWERMAN 10 MILLION INTERNET MARKETING CD will result in:

* Higher Response Rates

* Higher Sales Conversion Ratios

* More Receptive prospects; Less Flames & Non-Buyers.

* Less Contact With Anti-Commerce Radicals & Extremists.

Remember that potential income chart at the beginning of this message? Can you imagine the kind of money you could 
make if you mailed one million pieces and sold only one tenth (.01%) of one percent? You do the math, you'll be amazed!

This product will prove to be the best of it's kind compared to ANY CD in terms of hours and money spent bringing it to
market. No competitor will ever duplicate the effort of what it takes for us to produce this superb product. We never have 
compromised on quality, and surely won't release any product before it passes our ""high standards"" test.This is not a 
rental list that is restricted to a one-time mailing. You are purchasing an e-mail address list for your own personal mailings 
and may use it over-and-over.

"
926,1.0,"Hey there,

If you're like me, you've tried EVERYTHING to lose
weight.  I know how you feel - the special diets,
miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped
me lose a pound either.  It seemed like the harder I tried,
the bigger I got, until I heard about a product called
Extreme Power Plus.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister swore it helped her lose 23 pounds in just two weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a shot.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made. Period.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and got permission to resell it - at a BIG discount.  I want
to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I give you my personal pledge that Extreme Power Plus
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU.  If it doesn't, you can return it
any time for a full refund.    

If you are frustrated with trying other products, not having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - EXTREME
POWER PLUS.

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS, RESULTS, 
RESULTS!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's nothing to lose, and everything 
to gain.  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  That is my
pledge to you.

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order now and get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

934,1.0,"I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

944,1.0,"We are desperately looking for 100 lazy people 
            who wish to make lots of money without working.

         We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.
         We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich 
                   quick' scheme offered on the Internet.

            We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful 
            people, career builders or even college graduates.  
   We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.

         We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and 
       gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.  

           We want the people who stay in bed until noon.

    We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go 
      lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.

                          If you meet these criteria, go to:

                         livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com 

             and type in the Subject Line the following words:
                             ""I do not want to work"".  

            In fact, if you are so lazy that typing those words 
             in the Subject line is an effort, than don't bother.  

         Just click on the email and we'll know that you want 
     us to send you the domain name anyhow, because then 
              we will be absolutely certain that you are the 
                             kind of person we want.
       
               In case you haven't figured it out yet, we want 
                 the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.  

        If you are the kind of person who will consider doing 
     something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.  

                  This is too easy a way to make money 
                         and there's no challenge in it.

            If you can get to the website that we are going 
              to email you, you will be able to see the first 
       home business in history that requires no work.  NONE.  

               By clicking on this email and then going to 
               this website, you will be telling us that you 
            want to make enough money that you can quit 
                     your regular job and sleep all day.  

             We are not looking for a commitment from you 
                   and we don't even want your money. 

              As a matter of fact, we don't even want you 
            to hear from us again if the idea of making lots 
           of money without working does not interest you.  

                                  So this is the first 
                               and last email we will 
                                    ever send you.   
                                  That is a promise.

                        So if nothing else, remember this -  
                    to make money without working for it just 
                      send an email with the following words 
                 in the subject line:  ""I do not want to work"" to:

                             livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com 
 
                      and we will email you back with the 
                       website that gives you information 
                            on the best of both worlds - 
               a way to make money without having to work.

                     We look forward to hearing from you.

                     In all seriousness,

$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, 
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 

This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I 
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

=================================================== 

Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long 
time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again 
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. 
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made 
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first,

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and 
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: 

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== 

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 

=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. 

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But 
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 

========================================================== 

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 

==========================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
ordered Report # 2
. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report 
# 5
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
 
========================================================= 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are 
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 

======================================================= 

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receivethe report. 

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== 

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: 
Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT 
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name 
and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ 

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, 
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU 
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the 
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE 
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. 
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! 

====================================================== 

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS 
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you 
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST 
A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program 
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works 
exceedingly well as it is now. 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. 
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! 

============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. 
When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 

====================================================== 

''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big."" 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 

======================================================= 

''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered 
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks."" 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 

======================================================= 

''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."".

Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program

=22...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework,=20Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups,=20Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material,=20Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable=20production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World=20Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local=20resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)

"
950,1.0,"Dear Sir,

My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco
Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank
with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,
1997.

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive
as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my
branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom
his name shall be used as the
next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the
banking ethics here does not
allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view
of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing
that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give
you 25% of the total.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail
the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will
not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund
transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply
to the bank as a relation to the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying
Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.

Respectfully submitted,

Obi   W.

MR. AYANDA MAREDI
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.


Good morning,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive
US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.

This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.

May God's blessings be with you even as you reply.

Regards,


MR. AYANDA MAREDI

Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:

1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.
 
 Regards,
 
Moshood Seko Mobutu

While most people post their resumes on the top three job sites, such as Monster, 
HotJobs, and CareerBuilder, there are many other specialized job sites that employers 
and recruiters use to find candidates.

resume is read by nearly 100% of the employers and recruiters who are looking 
to hire or place candidates with your skills.

E-Mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com
LAGOS - NIGERIA. 

ATTN:  


REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. 

It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ""TOP SECRET"".
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. 

However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. 

The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. 

You must however NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below; 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of 20% from
the total amount. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date 
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
We are looking 
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
Total Confidentiality
in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us.
Transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most Government
executives. Here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty. I will
explain more to you when I have heard from you. 

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. 
I will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when I have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Dr.tom eke. 

N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS
TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL
AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY
LAUNDERING. THIS IS A
COMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

I also have received both the virus and email on how to get 
rid of it.  Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm 
expecting them and then am still very careful.  

Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing:

One Fix Tool:

Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive
C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS.
http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com

Another Trojan Fix Tool
http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com
The fix tool will run from your desktop and will ""automatically"" 
rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an 
entries from your registry files.

After running either fix tool -- reboot your system.

Hope this helps!

Dear Nicety,

As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking 
up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.  
There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts 
resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many 
programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working 
in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a 
regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened 
and closed several different applications.

Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,
wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating
system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at 
http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is 
even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about 
on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. 

 So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change 
the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of 
weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running 
I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. 
I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and 
the price is right -- free.

I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate 
sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well 
presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been 
a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, 
preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a 
relationship to it.

What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something 
related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this 
""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to 
click in the first place.

I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and 
not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the 
book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)

With these:

Email us at directions4U@aol.com        
and

copy and paste.

Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.

Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish 
between the links and that which is not.

I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also 
linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that 
link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.

If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a 
request message to an aol email address you would get more 
requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
~~~~

I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  
If only other sites we so simplistic!
~~~~

With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact 
on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences 
in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box 
with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of 
'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended 
to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 
year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of 
using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where 
or how or by whom it was discovered.

The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that 
would make the site more effective (on getting people to request 
the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in 
what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to 
order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form 
for this just about anywhere.

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

RE: BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

I have decided to contact your assistance in relation to the following business proposal, having obtained your contact through the commercial attach of your country's embassy in South Africa. This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.

Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!
. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law.

"
1001,1.0,"Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes 
is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Spambook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Spambook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Spambook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit email bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a<BR>
Money Judgment is and </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> why processing Money Judgments<BR>
can earn you very substantial income</FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000"">  .<BR>
<BR>
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you<BR>
will have a Money Judgment against them.<BR>
<BR>
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the<BR>
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the<BR>
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>
when they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>
dime.""<BR>
<BR>
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>
proportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>
between </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<=
BR>
Judgment debt</FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000"">  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>
Judgments take its place.<BR>
<BR>
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>
techniques necessary to succeed.<BR>
<BR>
With our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
By following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>
processing of Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
The income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> We<BR>
have associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>
and $100,000.00 per year </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000""> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>
offices.<BR>
<BR>
Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>
for reports.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>
payment of the principal.<BR>
<BR>
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> 92% of all of our associates work out of their ho=
me; 43%<BR>
are women and 36% are part time</FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000"">  .<BR>
<BR>
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>
are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>
<BR>
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>
are. You are not a collection agency.<BR>
<BR>
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>
are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>
to write to)<BR>
<BR>
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>
unless you want to.<BR>
<BR>
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>
<BR>
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>
companies charge $25.00.<BR>
<BR>
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>
course)<BR>
<BR>
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>
the original Judgment holder.<BR>
<BR>
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>
<BR>
Quote's from several of our students:<BR>
<BR>
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop<BR>
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> My<BR>
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000"">  . Your<BR>
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened<BR>
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.<BR>
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of<BR>
judgments he is working on.<BR>
<BR>
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in<BR>
area code 314 stated to us: "" </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> I am now making $2,000.00 per<BR>
week </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000""> and expect this to grow to twice this amount with=
in the<BR>
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in<BR>
judgments I am collecting on now.""<BR>
<BR>
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated<BR>
"" </FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#0000A0""> I am now making $12,000.00</FONT>
<FONT color=3D""#000000"">  per month and have approximately<BR>
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I<BR>
will have to hire someone to help out""<BR>
<BR>
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only<BR>
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I<BR>
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>
your course for 5 months""<BR>
<BR>
>From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>
why we can state the following:<BR>
<BR>
With our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>
A business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>
retire on and travel the world. A business which is<BR>
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every<BR>
day is new and exciting.<BR>
<BR>
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is<BR>
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate<BR>
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from<BR>
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full<BR>
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from<BR>
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you<BR>
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen<BR>
for many others already. Make it happen for you!<BR>

to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation<BR>

Every week, we publish the Interactive <br>
TV Power Rankings. We rank the 10 companies<br>
that are benefiting most from the deployment<br>
of new TV technology. <br>
<br>
This week's highlights:<br>
Will the FCC approve the Echostar-DIRECTV<br>
merger?; why did Cox scale back its Video<br>
on Demand plans?; why did Liberty Media buy<br>
a cable company in the Netherlands?; and <br>
who at NBC is smoking crack?<br>

TiVo: Now or Never?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=tpysjsn6.e9iqjsn6.wxb5wqn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvpredictions.com%2Fpredictions.html
Ready for this?<br>
<br>
The next five months could determine whether<br> 
TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service,<br>
ultimately survives as a business.<br>
<br>
TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less <br>
than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock<br>
dipped below three this week. And network execs<br>
are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>
which permits skipping commercials with a few <br>
clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>
models. There even have been hints that the <br>
networks could support a move by the cable <br>
industry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>
commercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>
be a TiVo. <br>
<br>
To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>
at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>
reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>
recommended the service to a friend. And when<br>
people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>
like the way people say ""Coke"" when they talk<br>
about soft drinks. )<br>
<br>
But Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>
are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>
putting some big numbers on the board -- <br>
and it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>
it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>
until now will run for the hills. That will push<br>
the company's stock price down even further. And<br>
if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>
Sell the company under duress or wait until its <br>
funding dries up. <br>
<br>
Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>
an intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>
five months, right through the holiday season.<br>
The blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>
retail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>
efforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>
Street -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>
the brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>
needs to show that it can generate<br>
mass consumer demand. <br>
<br>
How does TiVo demonstrate that?<br>
<br>
Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end<br>
will have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>
the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>
TiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>
service is not such a great selling point <br>
after all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>
not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>
to stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>
its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>
(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>
but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>
the merger is approved.) <br>
<br>
So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme<br>
to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided<br>
in the next several months. <br>
<br>
Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>
a partial success. The company will boost its <br>
subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>
as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>
also predict it will decide to sell the company<br>
to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>
even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>
necessary funding and industry connections<br>
for long-term growth and survival.<br>

Even when the Market takes a 300 odd point dive you can still make money
in the Stock Market if you know what you are doing.

If you don't know what you are doing follow people who do.

This week You could have made:

Up to 392% using The Lazy DayTrader System.

One Stock that you would have found immediately was a stock that was
trading at .55, until a large company announced that it was offering $1.10
for the shares.

What do you think happened to the value of the Shares?

Within the same day they went up to $1.10. 100% profit in one day!

There were 3 more examples like it this week which you would have found
within 5 seconds with the Lazy DayTrader System.

Learn how to do this at:

http://lazytrader.get.to

Our Chatroom this week made $455,000 trading 1000 shares with no losing
days.
